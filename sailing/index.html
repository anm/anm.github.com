        Since Autumn 2016 I have been living on and cruising a sailing yacht
        which I bought in Stockholm. It's a Scampi, 30ft (9m), made in Visby,
        Sweden. It's my latest technomadic platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017, we were sailing in the Baltic. You can read more about this
        in my <a href="/blog/2017/12/31/2017.html">2017 summary blog
        post</a>. I have also written about <a href="/blog/2018/01/12/boat-life.html">living on a boat</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For 2018, I have no definite plans yet, but will probably start
        sailing from N. Germany around mid April or May. I'd like to go to the
        Netherlands, and maybe up to Scotland.

      <h2>Crewing</h2>
      <p>At the moment I'm on my own on the boat, and would like someone to sail
      with. I'm open to possibilities of either joining for a specific trip or
      staying on the boat for a while. I probably won't be in a hurry to get
      anywhere though, so it is better if you are not in a rush.</p>

      <p>I eat mostly vegan food and would prefer that you do too. I have a low
      budget, so it won't cost much, but don't expect anything fancy.</p>

      <p>If you are interested you can email me to find out more.</p>
