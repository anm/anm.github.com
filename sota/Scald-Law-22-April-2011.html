I have been distracted
by <a href="/blog/2011/03/19/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-1.html">bike
radio</a> and thinking about unicycle mobile operations recently so wasn't
planning any SOTA activations but on the way home from work on Friday I met a
friend and learnt he was planning to go into the Pentlands, our local hills,
that night to test a new bivvy bag. This
sounded <a href="Black-Hill-bivvy-27-Jan-2011.html">rather familiar</a> but I
thought it would be a good excuse for some exercise that weekend so decided to
join him. Most of my equipment was surprisingly organised but I had to remove
the mast from my bike, which required cutting through an abundance of duct
tape and cable ties. Nevertheless I managed to get ready in about an hour. I
decided to keep things simple and not take the unicycle.
</p>

<p>
Colin had no particular plans for his trip. We got a lift up the road that
runs along the Pentland Hills with the intention to stop somewhere when we felt
like it. I spoiled this plan slightly by saying we should stop near Scald Law
and then continued to mention it until we had a plan to go up it. This was of
course because it is the highest hill in the area and qualifies for SOTA.
</p>

<p>
We set off at about 2330 and proceeded at a leisurely pace towards Scald
Law. It was theoretically dark but there was a much higher level of light
pollution than usual. I think the fog was reflecting it from Edinburgh and
surrounding settlements. There was initially some embarrassment about
navigation. We both knew the area but were still unsure exactly where we were
to start with. At night we judged scale and distance wrong - a nearby hump
looked like a large hill.
</p>

<p>
As well as the street lights and cars there were also occasional flashes from
an unidentified source. We initially thought it was cars but later decided it
must be lightning. It was not classic forking lightning but flashes over a
large area of low cloud.
</p>

<p>
It was also very warm and humid. As we climbed I felt the need to take my top
off. I have never needed to do this while walking in Scotland before and at
this time it was after midnight and still April. I was sweating anyway.
</p>

<p>
It became more obvious that this was thunder weather. I hoped we would be in
our bivvy bags before it started to pour. It also occurred to me that it might
not be a very good idea to put a mast up on top the highest available hill
during a lightning storm. I pondered this as we climbed.
</p>

<p>
We put up the mast anyway. I thought it might be interesting to see what would
happen. Also, if I got struck by lightning I probably wouldn't need to worry
about it for very long anyway.
</p>

<p>
I got set up and in my bivvy bag, and then tried a bit of radio, but the
battery seemed near flat. It started to rain. Then I touched the plastic case
of the battery and got a shock off it. I decided it would be a good idea to
disconnect the aerial at this point but maybe a bit stupidly touched the metal
connector, which gave a much worse shock. I became rather concerned around
this time when I realised I was in a constricted and space I could not get out
of very quickly, damp, and with the feeder from a mast on top of the highest
hill in the area in a lightning storm coming into it. Maybe this wasn't a very
good idea. I managed to undo the connector by holding it with some cloth, and
threw the cable outside. A spark jumped a couple of inches from the connector
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
In morning, I tried the radio again. No shocks this time, and interestingly
the battery had started working. Maybe the lightning had charged it up. :) I
made many good contacts, including the USA and Canada. Nothing on 2m. Colin
was getting bored though, so I packed up. We walked back over the hills
towards Edinburgh. In the fog, I could almost imagine we were on a
mountain. We reached Flotterstone for lunch, then walked further and down
Hillend for a bus home.
