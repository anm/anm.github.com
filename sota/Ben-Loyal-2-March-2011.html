<p>A brief report on a brief activation</p>

<p>Ben Loyal is FIXME: one of / the? most northerly mountains in
Scotland. It's near Tongue.  Loyal means level, which refers to the
summit plateau. There are three main peaks; the highest and SOTA
qualifying one is .... ...

<p>We approached from the (FIXME) (NE?), passing the end peak. The
path was poor and for the final section of climbing we just headed off
up in the expected direction of the summit. After a while I saw some
patches of snow and then rock through the mist. It tuned out we were
in the right place; then the peak loomed.</p>
 
<p>The summit is a large slab. Initially it looked like there would bd
a climb of moderate length over this. ALthough not at all steep this
concerned me because the rock was wet and exposed. It would be easy to
be blown over or slop and be blown over teh edge. It turned out that
further round there was only a short climb to the summit.</p>

<p>The wind would have made it difficult and possibly dangerous to
erect an HF antenna. It was also cold and unpleasant and I don't think
the father would have tolerated the time taken for an HF activation. I
almost did not actiate the summit at all but decided to try with the
handie at least. I had to be careful to hold onto everything. There
was quite a force on the aerial so I held that as well as the radio to
save the connector. I think the uper sections of the aerial bent
slightly.</p>

<p>Despite the remote location two contacts were made on 2m with
stations in Stornoway and Elgin. The first was from sitting a few
meters fro the trig point and the second with radio above trig and log
paper on it. I managed to post a spot by SMS but there was no response
- I probabably did not wait long enough. It was too cold. Operating
zips to put the radio away was difficult. I think some very thin and
tight gloves could be useful.</p>

<p>Descent was by closly retracing the ascent route, using boulders as
memorized waypoints, until off the peak. There were no cliffs after
this so it was simply a matter of pointing downhill until out of the
mist.</p>
