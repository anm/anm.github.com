MM0HAI's SOTA Activations
</title>

<body>

<h1>SOTA Operation</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.sota.org.uk/">Summits on the Air (SOTA)</a> is
an amateur radio award scheme designed to encourage people to operate
at the top of hills and mountains.</p>

<p>My first summit was Ben Chonzie, on 23 October 1999, about a year
after I was first licenced as 2M1GYX. This was years before SOTA came
about and it was hard to make any contacts.</p>

<p>Last year I discovered SOTA which has made things much easier
because now when I go up hills there are often people listening for
me. <a href="http://www.sotawatch.org/">SOTA watch</a> allows me to
post alerts of future activations. Spots of current activity can be
posted by anyone hearing an activator or from a summit using SMS.
</p>

<p>My full activation list is available in the SOTA database but
unfortunately this does not seem to be directly linkable. I've decided
to try writing up some of my activations now which I will list on this
page.</p>
