<h1>"Mobile" doesn't mean "in a car"</h1>

<p>I'm going to have a rant about people who seem to think the
"mobile" suffix means "in a car". I often now specify exactly how I am
mobile but you should not assume car mobile without qualification.</p>

According to the UK licence,
<blockquote>
<pre>
"Mobile" means the Radio Equipment is located in the United Kingdom:
    i. in or on any vehicle or conveyance;
    ii. on the person of the Licensee where the Licensee is a pedestrian
    iii. on any Vessel on Inland Waters;"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There are at least six <a href="./">modes of transport</a> fitting
this definition which I use the radio from and none of them are a
car.</p>

<p>So, don't call your product a mobile antenna when you really mean it's
an antenna for motorcars.</p>
