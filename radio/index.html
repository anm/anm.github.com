<title>Amateur Radio Operating Modes</title>

<h1>MM0HAI Operation</h1>
<h2>Modes of Operation</h2>
<p>I don't operate from the base station much. This is partly because
it's not a very good site: there is severe QRM and poor VHF
coverage. I also find it rather boring to hear someone say 5 and 9,
which is almost all they do on HF.</p>

<p>Instead, I like to combine radio with other activities: I do it in
interesting places and modes of transport.</p>

<p>As for places, this usually means up hills and
doing <a href="../sota/">SOTA activations</a>.</p>

<p>Transport includes bicycle, unicycle, kayak, train, and a long time
ago, bus. I have also operated <a href="maritime-mobile.html">maritime
mobile</a> from yachts but have yet to operating on the London
Underground<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> or a motorbike.

<a href="mobile.html">There are more
ways to be mobile than by using a car</a>.</p>

<p>I also operate pedestrian<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> mobile, usually in the
hills but occasionally in town.</p>

<h2>The Station</h2>
<p>The station currently consists of an Icom T8E, a Yaesu FT-817 and
an Icom 725.</p>

<p> The T8E produces 2W of FM from internal battery and is used for
SOTA activations with a telescopic whip. It is also used pedestrian,
bicycle and unicycle mobile, usually in a rucksac side pocket with
rubber duck and speaker mic.</p>

<p>The FT-817 is used at home for 6m ssb and VHF / UHF fm. It goes up
hills for SOTA. I've done some experiments with it on my bike for
HF. I used a short vertical antenna with loading coil fixed to the
carrier. The frame was connected through a variable capacitor to form
a ground.  I only tried this briefly and made no contacts but intend
to develop a better system.</p>

<p>The IC-725 is used only at home for HF amateur radio and for
listening to the shipping forecast on long wave. It just seems wrong
to listen to it on FM or iPlayer.</p>

Some people have tried underground railway operation.

<li id="fn2">I dislike the term pedestrian in this case because of its
modern connotations and limitation to built up areas. However, it seems
that it had
a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pedestrian#History">different
meaning in the past.</a>
