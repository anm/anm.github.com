  <h1>Mobile or Portable?</h1>
  <p>Amateur radio callsign suffixes</p>
</header>

<h2>Introduction and Approach</h2>
<p>This discussion is regarding terms of the UK Amateur Radio Licence.
Unfortunately this document is rather unclear and difficult to
interpret on some issues. I was motivated to write this because I have
been challenged on my use of the mobile suffix while on a summit and I
have been confused by a station reporting to be portable when
walking. In this article I try to make sense of determining whether
one is operating mobile or portable.</p>

<p>There seem to be two approaches to defining the correct suffix to
use. One is based on tradition and guessing what the other station
might think you mean. The other is to use the definition in the
licence and its notes. The problem with the first approach should be
clear: you do not know how the remote operator will interpret you. All
UK radio amateurs have a document which defines these suffixes. This
is the only common standard and the only one therefore that should be
used, even if it is not a very good one or you personally dislike
it. You may think a traditional interpretation is more easily
understood but that is not the case in general. It may be by people
who gained their licence at the same time as you but new operators who
have read their licence will not know what you mean.</p>

<p>I hope I have persuaded you that the correct approach is to follow
the usage defined in the licence. The first thing we must do then is
to read it! It is amazing how many radio amateurs seem not to have
read the document that defines their hobby, or alternatively chose to
ignore all updates since their licence was first issued. Reading it
will not solve all problems but it is a good start.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>
Let us then look at the licence to see how it defines the situations
in which you should use /M and /P.  Section identifiers refer to
the <a href="#ref-licence-terms">licence</a>.
</p>

In "Notes to the licence":
<blockquote>
<pre>
(d) When operating at locations other than the Main Station Address, it is recommended that
the following suffixes be used:

    I. If the Licensee operates the Radio Equipment at an Alternative Address, the
       Licensee may use the suffix “/A” with the Callsign;
    II. If the Licensee operates the Radio Equipment at a Temporary Location, the Licensee
        may use the suffix “/P” with the Callsign;
    III. If the Licensee operates the Radio Equipment from a Mobile location, the Licensee
         may use the suffix “/M” with the Callsign;
</pre>
</blockquote>

We see that the choice of suffix depends only on the "location" of the
equipment. Another important point is that these suffixes are only
"recommended". You "may use" them, or not.

<h3>Portable</h3>
You are portable if at a temporary location. (by (d)(ii))

<blockquote>
<pre>
(jj) “Temporary Location” means a fixed location in the United Kingdom which is not
the Main Station Address or an Alternative Address;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Unfortunately "fixed location" is not defined. Some interpretations I have come across are:
<ol>
<li>The station is physically fixed to the ground. This could be
because of pegging a mast into the ground or connecting to shore
power.<a href="#fn-yachting">[1]</a></li>

<li>The station does not move for the period of operation. For
example, a parked car or person sitting with handheld. Note I did not
define "period of operation".</li>

<li>The station remains within some defined area. This includes
situations in the last definition but adds things like walking around
in the region of a mountain top.</li>
</ol>

<p>I cannot tell you which of these, if any, is officially correct, but I
make some recommendations below.</p>

<h3>Mobile</h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>
17(1)(x) “Mobile” means the Radio Equipment is located in the United Kingdom:
    I. in or on any vehicle or conveyance;
    II. on the person of the Licensee where the Licensee is a pedestrian; or
    III. on any Vessel on Inland Waters;
</pre>
</blockquote>

This seems clear enough.

<h3>Non-exclusivity</h3>

Let us now return to the question, "Am I mobile or portable?". We have
seen the definitions of each and can note that they are not
exclusive. That is, you can be portable and mobile at the same time!
For example, if you are anchored in inland waters I would consider
that to be a fixed location. The same goes for a car that has
deployed a mast on the ground. According to the licence, I could sign
as MM0HAI/M/P (or MM0HAI/P/M) in these circumstances.

<h2>Examples and Recommendation</h2>
<p>The suffixes are optional. I suggest using them if you think they
will be useful. I think this is almost always the case, so suggest you
use them by default.</p>

<p>We have seen that within the licence terms there is some room for
interpretation. It makes sense to chose the interpretation that best
communicates the situation of the station.</p>

<p>I recommend:
<ol>
<li>Use definition 1 of fixed location, unless circumstances make it
more useful to use another. (See examples)</li>
 
<li>Use at most one of /P and /M. This is in accordance with normal
practice. Using more than one is likely to confuse.</li>

<li>When both mobile and portable, chose based on your ability to
operate the equipment and the affect your situation may have on your
signal. This, I suspect, is the most useful information you could
communicate in the suffix. Generally, if you are both mobile and
portable then use mobile.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<th>Situation</th>
<th>Suffix</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
On summit, using handheld radio on trig point
</td>
<td> /M. </td>

<td>In this situation,
you have your hands full: logging is difficult and the antenna will be
flapping around. You may be delayed in responding to an over because
you need to stand up to get the aerial high enough and sit down to
write or get a Mars bar out your rucksac.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Walking around a summit:</td>
<td>/M</td>
<td>As above and your signal may vary with position.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Sitting in car, antenna pegged to ground.</td>
<td>/P</td>
<td>You are physically fixed, so certainly qualify for /P. You don't
need to worry about effects of moving, e.g. changing signal,
distraction, so /M not helpful.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Sitting in car, not fixed to ground (antenna on car
only). Intention to remain at same location for some time.</td>
<td>/P</td>
<td>You can get comfortable, get log book out and generally forget
about moving.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Sitting in car, not fixed to ground (antenna on car
only). Likely to need to move at short notice</td>
<td>/M</td>
<td>May be affected by mobile issues and can't get too
comfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unicycling on the deck of a vessel at sea, which is holding
station.</td>
<td>/M/MM/P</td>
<td>It's far too good to stick to my one suffix suggestion.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Read the licence and follow it. The remaining ambiguity is chiefly
that of defining what is meant by fixed location. Do this such as to
provide the most useful information about your circumstances as they
may affect the QSO.</p>

<p>Do not do something because everyone else does it. Do it because it
is correct.</p>

<h2>Historical Notes</h2>
I think much of the confusion arises from changes in the rules.

M1MAJ says (<a href="#ref-sota">sota</a>):
<blockquote>
Way back in the days before BR68, the standard licence did not permit
operation from a motor vehicle. You needed to obtain (and pay for) a
separate licence for that (just as you once needed a separate licence
to have a broadcast radio in a car). That licence specified the /M
suffix, which wasn't mentioned at all in the ordinary
licence. Self-contained equipment that could be carried was much less
common in those days, but such operation was possible, and legal under
an ordinary licence, but could only be under a /P suffix. BR68 changed
all that several decades ago, but the myth that /M means motor vehicle
(only) has persisted to this day.
</blockquote>

Brian, G8ADD says (<a href="#ref-sota">sota</a>):
<blockquote>
I have my first licence issued in 1964 put away so safely that I can't
find it! This is from a re-issue in 1977:

<pre>
9.(1)(b) at the temporary premises the suffix "/A" shall be added to
the callsign.
9.(1)(c) at the temporary location or as a pedestrian the suffix "/P"
shall be added to the callsign.
9.(1)(d) in or on a vehicle or vessel the suffix "/M" shall be added
to the callsign.
9.(4) When the station is used at the temporary premises or location,
the address of the temporary premises or location shall be sent at the
beginning and end of the establishment of communication with each
separate amateur station, or at intervals of 15 minutes, whichever is
more frequent.
</pre>

That is how it used to be, and I can add that we puzzled long and hard
about exactly what 9.(4) meant!
</blockquote>

Geoff, G6MZX replies with:<br />
<blockquote>And that is rightly or wrongly the way that I interprit it now</blockquote>

So there you have it. Ignore your licence and just do what the 1977 one says instead.

If you think the mobile / portable issue is bad enough, don't get

you /A, /M, /P or should you just make something up / forget about the
whole mess?
