My working method has more often than not involved the subtraction of
weight. I have tried to remove weight, sometimes from people, sometimes from
heavenly bodies, sometimes from cities; above all I have tried to remove
weight from the structure of stories and from language.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe I was only
then becoming aware of the weight, the inertia, the opacity of the world
-- qualities that stick to the writing from the start, unless one finds
some way of evading them.

A vessel is useful only through its emptiness. It is the space opened in a
wall that serves as a window. Thus it is the nonexistent in things which makes
them serviceable.
