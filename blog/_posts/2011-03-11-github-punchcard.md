I pushed my [HTML5 Game of Life](/life/life.html) to
[github](https://github.com/anm/HTML5-Game-of-Life/) today. I hadn't
noticed it before, but github generates some charts of commit
activity. This is what I got for my life project.

My work is fairly evenly spread out, as I would expect. It looks like
I don't work much on Fridays or Saturday nights though. How strange.

I'm sure there are various fun things I could do with this sort of
data. Perhaps classify coders into categories like crepuscular,
diurnal, and nocturnal. What about matching up to people who like to
work at the same time? Or sleep at the same time. :-) I must make a
hacker dating site at once.
