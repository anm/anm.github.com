I spent the weekend at a cottage on the edge of Roslin village, right beside
the chapel. The house is dated 1660. There was graffiti scratched on my
bedroom window dated 1899. It's interesting to think about all the people who
must have stayed here. It used to be an inn, and a Freemason lodge met
here. Now it is rented out.

I found a book in the house about green men. It said there are 103 green men
in the chapel, and only one Jesus. The Green Man appears in the Beltane Fire
Festival in Edinburgh, and in another form as the Summer King at Samhuinn. I
was interested to learn more about this character. Roslin chapel lies above a
forested glen, which is also a place of magical interest, and somewhere you
might see a green man. :)

There is a circle of stones in the garden that looks like it used to be a
well. There is a tradition of visiting holy wells at Imbolc, so it was
interesting to find one here. I walked round it.
