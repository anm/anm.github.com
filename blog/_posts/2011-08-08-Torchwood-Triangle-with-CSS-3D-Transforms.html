<style>
  .spin {
    -webkit-transition: all 2s linear;
    -webkit-transform: rotateY(180deg);
  }
</style>

<script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js></script>

<script>
  var angle = 180;
      setInterval(function () {
          if (angle == 0) { angle = 180 } else { angle = 0 }
          $(".spin").css("-webkit-transform", "rotateY(" + angle + "deg)");
      }, 2000);

</script>

<svg class="spin centre" width="100px" height="100px">
  <polygon points="0,100  50,14 100,100" fill="none" stroke="#555" stroke-width="2"/> 
</svg>

<p>
I was watching Torchwood this evening when for some reason the spinning
triangle suddenly made me think of CSS 3D transforms. I had to do it.
</p>

<p>
The triangle is an inline svg. CSS specifies that transitions should be done
smoothly over time. Javascript pokes the triangle every two seconds to rotate
it. Requires webkit for now.

<p>Update: This seems to be the symbol of "The Families".</p>

<h3>Update: A better version and Mobile Apps</h3>

Here is a version on its own page, with correct
colours: <a href="http://mm0hai.net/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/">Torchwood
Spinning Triangle</a>. In Chrome, it glows.

<h4>iPhone / iOS</h4>

The same version can also be installed as an iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) app,
although it seems to be rather
temperamental. Visit <a href="http://mm0hai.net/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/">the
page</a> on your iOS device then press the bookmark button and select "Add to
Home Screen".

<h4>Android</h4>

I've also turned it into
a <a href="/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/Torchwood_Triangle.apk">native
Android App</a>. I have no idea if this works - I have never made an Android
app before and I don't even have a device to test it on! I'll be very
surprised and pleased to hear if it does work. If so, I might make a better
version and put it on the Android Marketplace.
