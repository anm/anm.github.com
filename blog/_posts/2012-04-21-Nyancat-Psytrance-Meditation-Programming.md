My highest score at <a href="http://nyan.cat">nyan.cat</a> was achieved when
programming. I was at work and struggling to get much done. Then I put on
nyan cat and within a few hours I had resolved several issues. I guessed it
might be helping because it occupied the part of my brain that usually would be
free to distract me by generating unrelated thoughts.

I also like to listen to <a
href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psytrance">psytrance</a> music when
programming. I thought it was good because it is simple and repetitive, so
unlikely to be distracting. It's also fast and good for keeping me awake for
long hacking sessions.

Meditation also can help to clear the mind of unwanted thoughts and aid
concentration. I think this state of focus is what some programmers call flow.

I suspect now that trance music and meditation probably produce similar mental
states, which aid concentration and getting things done. I therefore recommend
that offices should play repetitive music such as nyan cat to boost
productivity and increase moral. :) I also recommend hacking at psytrance
parties.
