<q>I organise a vegan crunk night.</q>

Now that I am eating vegan, I feel like I can somewhat legitimately organise a
vegan crunk night. I still don't know what one is meant to be, but that didn't
stop me and on Saturday we had one. There were tasty vegan noms, potluck
style. Apparently crunk is a kind of southern hip-hop, but none of us were
keen on that so we decided table top games would be a reasonable
substitute. :)

If you don't know what I'm talking about you need to watch this excellent
video.
