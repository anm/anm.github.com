I have felt sick since I got here three weeks ago. The poor hygiene at the
Rainbow Gathering is partly to blame, but that is not all I mean.

The food is awful. In April, I decided to adopt a vegan diet, and to give up
sugar. Here, the main foods available are meat, cheese and sugar. It's very
difficult to find anything else.

What would be a corner shop in the UK, with things like bread, fruit,
vegetables, newspapers and snacks, here has only sugary snacks, crisps and
sugary drinks. There are many of these all the same.

I tried asking at a restaurant for vegetarian food. I told them what I didn't
eat, and that I like rice, beans, and vegetables. They refused to serve
me. They didn't say they didn't have those things, they just refused to sell
something without meat. I thought they must be particularly obnoxious so I
tried somewhere else and the same thing happened. Then I found somewhere with
a vegetarian menu on the wall. This included chicken and fish, but at the
bottom it said a salad of rice and vegetables. I asked about it and was told
they couldn't do it.

I decided today to buy things and make my own food to have the first vegan
meal I would have had here. I bought some tostadas (crunchy corn tortillas),
refried beans, salsa, avocado and tomato. When I opened the tin of refried
beans I thought they smelled a bit off but I ate some anyway. Then I checked
the ingredients and found pig fat and MSG. This reminded me of when I found a
can of lentils in the supermarket and got excited that there was something to
eat. Then I saw there was sausage in it. Mexicans seem to believe if it
doesn't have animal in it it is not food.

It seems the only safe things to eat are whole fresh fruit and vegetables, and
bottled water. I could buy vegetables myself and eat raw, or cook if I have
wood or get a stove. Vegetables here though are covered in bacteria, and it is
necessary to soak them in poison to kill the bacteria first.

Mexican traders border on thieves. In general anything without a marked price
will have the price increased substantially if you are white. I have had some
particularly bad experiences though.

I went to a restaurant with fixed menu for 90 peso, which included a
drink. Bill added drink, with the excuse that water with lemon was not
included, but water with melon was. Both were offered when I asked for what
was on the set menu. I complained and got another bill without that charge,
but mysteriously written at the bottom was 100 peso, this time with no
justification. I paid that but they certainly did not get any further tip.

I went to a roadside food place that served the usual variety of meat and
cheese with tortilla in some form. I ordered three quesadilla - the only
option without meat. These typically cost 10 pesos. I received them with
prawn. I highly dislike prawns. I wanted some water but for some reason I had
a bad feeling about this place and thought they would try to overcharge so
decided to leave that for now and get elsewhere. Expected bill: 30 peso. The
bill was 150 pesos. Of course I refused to pay. In the end I gave her 50 pesos
in disgust and tried to leave. Then something bizarre happened - a girl
started to sing something and an older man did some mime. There was something
about a house. I suspect it was begging and they were trying to say you are
rich and going to stay in a house but I don't really know. Actually I don't
have a house, only a bike, and was sleeping outside.

Man in the posada I am staying in now initially asked for 20 pesos extra
because I have a bike. That was so ridiculous even his wife said so, and I did
not pay. The room is dirty and smells and he does not
care. He is a great slug living at the base of a tree and slowly killing
it while he gets fat.

Almost all service I have received from restaurants and some shops in Palenque
has been bad. Waitresses who seem to forget what they are there for and think
who seem annoyed at having to do anything seem to be the norm. In a cafe I was
asked to leave after an hour of using my laptop. It was not busy so they were
not losing money on the table. I did not go back to what was until then my
favourite cafe, so they are now losing for that.

Today I had a new mounting frame made for my bike. The man did about the worst
job possible that could possibly work. He made me feel like asking him to do
it properly would be a great imposition and unreasonable, rather than what I
was paying him for.

I feel sick from the food. If diet is also why I am always tired and weak,
maybe everyone here is like that. That would explain why noone seems
interested in or able to do their job. I certainly could not work well here.

Summary: Mexican food is awful and the climate is stifling. Many Mexicans I
have had to deal with are lazy, unhelpful, and borderline thieves.
