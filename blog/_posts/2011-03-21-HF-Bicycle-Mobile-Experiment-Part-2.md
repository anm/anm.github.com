This evening I tested the antenna system described in my <a
rel="prev" href="/blog/2011/03/19/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-1.html">last
post</a>, as well as a 2m J-pole.

Immediately on leaving the house I was answered on 2m by GM8OTI. This
was an unexpectedly good start - most often when I have tried 2m bike
radio I get nothing. The J-Pole was probably much better than previous
antennas and he said he had seen my post on SOTA watch so was
expecting me. I extended only one section of the mast for the journey,
which was just enough for the J-pole.

I planned to operate in the vicinity of Newhaven Lighthouse in the
hope that proximity to sea water would provide a good ground
plane. When I arrived at the lighthouse I could start operating very
quickly as I only had to extend the mast. This is in contrast to the
usual faff of setting up for <a href="/sota">SOTA</a> which involves guy lines.

The band (15 meters) sounded dead - I heard no stations at all. I
thought conditions must be bad but I tried calling CQ anyway and,
although rather slow, I got some results!

<table>

<tr><td>~1830</td> <td>145.500</td> <td>GM8OTI</td> <td>59</td> <td>59-57</td></tr>
<tr><td>~1915</td> <td>21.280</td>  <td>GM8OTI</td> <td>21</td> <td>?</td></tr>

</table>

I had never heard the CO prefix before but didn't think much of it
until I got home and looked it up. QRZ.com tells me C06LC is in Cuba,
4441 miles away. I think voltage was down to about 10V or less at this
point so I probably wasn't even using the nominal 5W I usually
claim. I think that is my furthest contact - QRP or otherwise. It's at
least 888 miles / watt and probably over 1000.

Effectiveness varied greatly with location. Near the lighthouse
was good but when I tried moving north west along the coast it was far
worse. I heard N8YHY at S1 - when I moved back to the lighthouse it
increased to S8.

I spent some time after these contacts listening on bands from 160m to
10m. I was surprised to hear stations on 160 meters with my short
antenna - one who sounded English on SSB and several morse which I
didn't try and decode. I also tried adding a miracle whip tuner. I
think it tuned on 17m and 20m but battery was now flat so could not
test properly.

It was generally a pleasant evening - warm and dry but windy. The sky
was clear giving good star display and a shooting star. There were
some very good photos I would like to have taken - with railings, bike
and mast in the foreground, lighthouse beyond that and stars behind -
but my camera phone was not up to the job. I was not, on this
occasion, questioned by police or public about my unusual activities,
nor about the fact my bike had wires on it. As we now know, <a
href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i_pDxEAYSiWgBNlLs8ALAyGID7Lw">wires
are evil</a> unless they come in a box with the name of a big company
on it.

In conclusion, I declare this operation successful and intend to
experiment further.

<h3>Solar Data</h3> For future reference / comparison, the solar data
from N0NBH for this evening (2115 UTC I think it was but I can't find
historical data to check) was:

SFI 101
SN 47
A-Index 3
K-Index 1

15 meter conditions were pronounced to be fair.
