The Palenque Rainbow Gathering is one reason I came to Mexico now, to begin
cycling at the End of the World.

I arrived in Palenque by overnight bus, had breakfast and set off down the road.

Leaving Palenque there was a short section of main road before reaching the
turnoff for the Rainbow. Then the road was awful. Very bumpy surface, rocks,
and it went up and down. My bike was heavily loaded and I was not particularly
fit. On the way up the road, though, I met a friend I last saw in Europe a
year ago, who was walking to town. :)

Eventually I arrived, and one of the first things I did was go for a swim in
 the river pools.

I went for a walk around to explore and look for a campsite. On the way back
to get my bike and things I met three other cycle tourists who had just
arrived. <a href="http://chaingethecycle.org/">Mykal and Nico</a>, who were
cycling to Guatemala to help build an earth ship, and Lance, who was cycling
to Panama. We set up camp together. I stayed for the next two weeks.
