title: SGC SG-211 Mini Smartuner Teardown
---

My<sup>1</sup> SGC autotuner had an accident when I stupidly put it down on a
bench. The boat heeled and it landed on the connector, bending it. Luckily the
connector was mounted on the case and wired up, rather than soldered directly
to the board, so there was no damage other than a bent box. I took it apart
so I could straighten it out and thought I might as well take some photos
while I was at it.

The item in question is an <a

to review it or say much other than it is pretty good and the case is soft
aluminium.

The relays are interesting. I have been meaning to design an automatic ground
tuner for my <a
href="/blog/2011/03/25/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-3.html">bike</a> but
one problem I have is the inability to find any latching relays. It seems SGC
either had their own made, or have had some branded to hide where they get
these mythical devices.

The white wire is connected to a front panel toggle switch which was added by
SGC. The new switch disables retuning to avoid a problem where it would retune
in the middle of an over. I'm not sure if the uninsulated wires above this are
part of the mod. I hope they are not fixing a bad board. The switch is useful
but I'm a bit concerned about what this will do for durability. The controller
is a PIC.
