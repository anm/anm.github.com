The first time I visited London on my own I went for a walk around the
City. Apart from various novelties like seeing the most people evar wearing
suits in one place and paying 7 GPB for a sandwich I was interested in the
buildings.

London is an organic city. It was not planned, it doesn't have blocks. It has
evolved and grown. Like trees in a rainforest, the buildings have become
taller. Evolution requires old organisms to die, leaving space for new
generations. It is the same with buildings.

I especially like the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam">Gherkin</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe">30 St Mary Annexe</a>. This
was built on the site of a previous building which was destroyed by a
bomb. Without this <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva">destruction</a>, there would be no
new building.

Some forests are like this too. Pyriscent seeds only germinate when
burnt. Seedlings need the space and light created by the fire.

<blockquote>
<p>
"Many plant species in naturally fire-affected environments require fire to
germinate, to establish, or to reproduce, or all three. Fire suppression not
only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them."

London is a forest.

I am concerned that some interpretation of the <a

Act 2006</a> might make writing this post punishable by 7 years in
prison. Therefore, I will add that I am not trying to encourage you to blow up
buildings or set forests on fire. It is probably not a good idea to set fire
to forests, but when it happens naturally or when old buildings fall apart,
there may be some benefits. Really, I'm not trying to comment on whether these
things are good or bad, I'm just noting how they are.
