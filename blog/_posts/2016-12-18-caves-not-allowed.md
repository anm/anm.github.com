Last time en Canarias, I discovered some caves and slept in them a while. I
was excited at the novelty, and to discover how good caves are for
living. They stay warm at night because the rock holds the heat of the
day. They surround you with warmth and look after you. It is like mother
nature saying "I love you, here is a home I made for you".

The government says no. No entry. Private hunting estate. Only killing allowed
here, not living. Go and pay someone to make you a concrete box.

Now I'm angry.
