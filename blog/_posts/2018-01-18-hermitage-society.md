Recently, the boat has been my hermitage. We are moored in a place of nothing
to do, but it is calm. It's really quite pleasant when the weather is
co√∂perating, even in winter the cold is compensated for by views of ice and
frost and snow.

I have spent some months on my own. Sometimes I am depressed, and sometimes
happy, but I think this would be the case wherever I was. Being alone is not a
problem.

I only noticed being lonely when I returned to society. Being at a large
event, or even in a city, is lonely if you don't have friends. Boat in the
middle of nowhere is fine though.

The main thing I noticed missing when I started talking to people was
ideas. Talking to people and going to lectures helped me come up with some new
projects. I didn't realise this was something I was missing last year. Not
just when on my own, but after a whole year with only one other person, there
are not many new ideas either.
