I very rarely lose things, but recently I lost a cooking pot, by proxy. I lent
it to someone. The last thing I remember losing before that was a lighter. The
lighter I was given by someone at a house I stayed in, and it was lost when I
lent it to someone in another house.

The lost pot I bought, but then I remembered when I was on La Palma, I had
acquired a pot after a party, because I needed one to go walking in the
mountains. People told me it would be ok to take one if I asked around and
checked it did not belong to anyone in particular. I think it came from the
communal equipment collection at the nearby cave community, where many of the
people were Rainbow. I think my pot was taken by someone when it was left
lying around at the Oaxaca Rainbow gathering.

I started to wonder if I was going to lose the spoon I got on La Palma too,
but then I remembered I had given a KFS to someone at the Palenque Rainbow, so
it is probably safe. :)

Property seems to flow more when travelling. Property and people.

When I set off on this cycling journey I left a girl in Edinburgh. This
morning a girl left me to travel south.
