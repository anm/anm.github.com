There are various ways to get from Panama to Colombia: flying, cargo boat in
the Pacific, small cargo launches between islands in the Caribbean, and a
sailing yacht in the Caribbean are some of the options. Travel by land is a
serious undertaking and very rarely done. The area between the countries is
called the Darien Gap: here there is a break in the Panamerican Highway, and
nothing but thick jungle and various natural and man made dangers. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme">difficulty Scots had living
here</a> is one reason why Scotland joined with England and became Great
Britain.

I wanted to take a boat anyway, and preferably a bigger sailing to keep my
bike away from the salt. I tried hitchiking from Portobelo and Puerto Lindo,
but in the end decided just to pay the tourist rate for a berth on the
Santana. Although very expensive, it was not a bad decision. The San Blas
islands along the Panama coast are the classic tropical islands, many with
nothing but sand and a few palm trees.

I joined the boat in Puerto Lindo. It turned out the wrapping was not really
necessary.

Officially leaving Panama was the easiest border so far. The captain took our
passports to this office while we did nothing.

It is obviously a popular place for cruisers.

The Kuna people inhabit these islands. I don't know how they manage with so
little resources, but one thing they do now is sell lobsters and beaded
jewellery to tourists on the big boats.
