I don't think you understand how important this is. This is not a toy or for
going to the shops. This is for tens of thousands of miles of dirt roads,
jungles, deserts and mountains. This is my home for years. For the majority
of people I meet for the next few years, this is all they will remember of
me. You did this like you had no time for better, then spent the rest of the
day standing around doing nothing.

This morning I started to cry. I put on Runrig, "Road and the River", which
triggered it, although I almost felt like crying when I saw your work
yesterday. I should have insisted you do it better. I didn't negotiate the
price down because I wanted you to be interested enough in it to do a good
job. Apparently that didn't work. The only reason I let you continue and paid
you is because I couldn't move without it. Something that might last a few
hundred miles would at least let me escape this place now. The one thing that
was good about this work was that it was done by 3pm the day it started.

Now I am sitting right next to a freedom machine but still feel trapped. I
don't know if I can cycle because of illness. If I do I'll probably get wet
when my tent leaks again. If I want better gear I will need to wait for it to
be delivered here - I think there is no chance of buying something that is not
rubbish here. That means waiting somewhere - again I am trapped. All the time
I can't even eat anything that is not poison, so it's not surprising I have
been ill for nearly two weeks. The current cold that is, not diarrhoea and
vomiting immediately preceding. And it will probably take days to choose things
and order them on the internet, and most of the days will be wasted trying to
find working wifi.

I am thinking too much. I can get out of an hotel room in the morning without
thinking - I have done this before. I am going to cycle, kit be dammed. I am
going to ride my bike today whether I have a map and a waterproof tent or not.

Now I feel better. I'm going to have breakfast.
