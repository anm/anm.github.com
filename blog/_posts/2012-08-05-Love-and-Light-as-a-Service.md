I was walking with a girl in Maspalomas and discussing the squatting and
recycling lifestyle when a tourist turned round and gave her â‚¬20. We don't
know why.

I asked her how she felt about taking money for nothing. I don't really like
the idea. She argued that she did not just take from the conventional society,
but provided some value, by spreading love and light.

Initially I thought this sounded like ridiculous hippie nonsense but later I
came to think that it is true. I think most people, ultimately, just want to be
happy. One thing that I find makes me happy is being around happy people.

I believe there is a French saying that "there is only one smile". When
someone sees the smile, zie then smiles, and so the smile is passed on. Thus a
pool of unfettered happy people should help to support global happiness.

I think the world would be a much better place if there were more people who
dedicated themselves to happiness. What else is life for?

So what about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud
based</a> Love & Light <a

that's going to be called heaven.io and have plenty of node.js and rounded
corners.
