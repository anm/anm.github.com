title: Cheap but not rubbish multimeters available in the UK
tags: [electronics]

I used to have only cheap and nasty multimeters, but Dave Jones of the EEVBlog
convinced me that it was worth getting a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoeUgMFLyAw">half decent</a> one. I like
his videos; they are worth watching to learn about meters in general as well
as the specific ones he reviews.

I spent some time looking for where I could get good brand meters here for not
too ridiculous prices (relative to the US and Australia). I made a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlSnQD_VeghadEpwSmQ5cFZRQkM5OWxxSjUwZm83OHc">spreadsheet
of Amprobe, Extech and UNI-T meters between £25 and about £70 and where you
can buy them</a>. Maybe some of the other brands available in the UK are a
better deal but I have no data on their quality.

I've now ordered an Extech EX330.
