I thought after my <a href="/blog/2011/07/18/MongoDB-Marketing.html">last post
on MongoDB</a> it would only be fair to do one on <a
href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>. How do I know about CouchDB?
Well, I think it shows up on hacker news less often than Mongo so the main
reason I know about it is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/daleharvey/">Dale
Harvey</a>. Dale works for <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>
and is sometimes seen wearing his CouchDB t-shirt in Appleton Tower, hub of <a
href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/">Edinburgh's startup scene</a> and where I
work.

He's <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/16244683">spoken about CouchDB</a> at
Edinburgh's Tech Meetup. Most of the rest of what I know about Couch has come
from Dale while in the pub.

What's the point of this post? Have a good ambassador. How do you get them?
Make something hackers like. It probably helps to do it in a fun language like
Erlang.
