In English, it's hard to know what to call that thing you are tying your boat
up to. It could be:

- Pier
- Jetty
- Berth
- Dock
- Wharf
- Quay
- Pontoon
- Mole
- Slip (American English)

The definitions of all these terms depend on if you are speaking English or
American, and also seem to be rather fuzzy. However, there is an easy solution:

**Brygge**

It's much easier if you just use Norwegian / Danish / Swedish
(Brygga). Everything is a brygge. It's possible, but not necessary to be more
precise about what kind of brygge it is, for example a flytebrygge is a floaty
brygge, or pontoon, but it's always a brygge. This word I have imported into
English, and it makes life a lot easier.
