    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m starting to really feel Proudhon.</p>

<p>When I was last here, we shared a cave between around ten of us. If a stranger
had come, we would have undoubtedly invited them to join us round the fire. I
returned to the cave this night, and found that the lock on the bars that were
installed when the policia threw us out had been broken, and replaced. I stood
and contemplated my history here, until presently I heard the gate
open. “Buenas”, “Hola”, I said. “Vaya vaya, … mi cueva! …”. He wanted me
out the barranco. He even claimed the neighbouring caves, the view maybe…</p>

<p>Previously, on this Canarian trip, I visited La Tomatera. The shared meals
round the one table were gone. The kitchen was bare. One man ate a takeaway
sandwich. Instead of a welcome note, the fridge said “Kill all hippies”.  A
room had a lock. I suspect most of the soft furnishings, the comfort, had gone
behind it.</p>

<p>I feel like the island has lost its soul. The stage is still here but the
actors gone. Of course it was the people who made what we had here
before. It’s probably stupid to say the island has changed. It’s been here
forever compared to us. The cave I’m writing in now was occupied before the
Spanish came. The bars will break soon enough.</p>

<p>Property is theft.</p>

<p>Last time en Canarias, I discovered some caves and slept in them a while. I
was excited at the novelty, and to discover how good caves are for
living. They stay warm at night because the rock holds the heat of the
day. They surround you with warmth and look after you. It is like mother
nature saying “I love you, here is a home I made for you”.</p>

<p>The government says no. No entry. Private hunting estate. Only killing allowed
here, not living. Go and pay someone to make you a concrete box.</p>

<p>Now I’m angry.</p>

    <link href="https://mm0hai.net/blog/2016/12/15/How-to-register-for-Las-Palmas-city-bikes-bybike.html"/>

    <id>https://mm0hai.net/blog/2016/12/15/How-to-register-for-Las-Palmas-city-bikes-bybike</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has a municipal bike system, but registering for it
is rather complicated and especially difficult if you don’t live here and
understand Spanish, so I decide to write a guide, as I have just done it. The
system is available to non-residents.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-get">What you get</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can pick up a bike at any point and return it to any other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can keep the bike out for up to one hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After returning, you need to wait 15 minutes to use one again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can borrow a bike up to five times per day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Rental is done with a smartcard or a phone app.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-costs">What it Costs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.50 EUR for the smart card, which also can be used for busses. Usage is
free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly various fees if you are late returning the bike or lose the bike,
don’t report them as damaged…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-register">How to Register</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fill in this
<a href="http://www.bybikelpa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=85&amp;lang=en">form</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will receive two emails. Ignore the first.  In the second email, click
the link “HAGA CLICK AQUÍ”.  This takes you to a form which asks for your
Spanish tax number. You don’t need one. What you actually should enter here
is your passport or ID document number that you put in the last form. Follow
the process for verifying phone number. (You must receive a text message.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait for 24 to 48 hours, then go to one of the registration offices with
your passport or ID. A few offices are listed in the emails you are sent,
but I actually went to San Telmo bus station, which was not listed but
worked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a BONOGUAGUA smart card for 1.50 EUR. It is yellow. At San Telmo, you
can do this at the ticket office with the glass window, in a corner. I think
you can also do it at a machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the ByBike / Bus office. At San Telmo, this is the larger office you
can walk into, to the right of the glass ticket office booth. Give them your
ID, yellow card, and say you want to register for ByBike. “Quiero
registrarme para ByBike”. They will look you up on the computer. If you
waited long enough since the last step, they will validate it and that
should be other. Otherwise it might still be “pendiente” - come back later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should now be able to use the bikes!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-bikes">Using the Bikes</h2>

<p>You can use the card, or a mobile app. The app shows where stations are, and
how many bikes and spaces are at each place. You can also take a bike out
without the card at most stations.</p>

<p>For the app (optional):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Download the app:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usualbike.bybikeLPA">Android</a>
or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/bybike-lpa/id975121273?mt=8">iOS</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Login with username and password that you will receive in a third email,
after your ID is validated at the office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a screenshot of the map while you still have internet, because the app
does not work at all offline.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The whole system is badly designed and maintained. Check the bike thoroughly
before you try to take it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The card readers almost don’t work at all. Try holding the card at 90
degrees to the way indicated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Count the number of usages in a day, because if you try a sixth loan, it
will work, but then block you for a month! Days end at midnight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <updated>2016-09-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://mm0hai.net/blog/2016/09/25/two-cats-one-boat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5836/30583122980_5ebe6a8ef3_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="2 Cats 1 Boat - Scampi 30" /></p>

<p>After sailing on other people’s boats for a while, I finally got my own. I’m
planning to live aboard and travel. It seems like a good way to have more
comfort than most ways of travelling - you take your bed, kitchen, etc. with
you - but you are not stuck in one place as you are with a house. For the
moment the boat is on land in Stockholm, but in the Spring we should be ready
to go.</p>

<p>The boat is a Shipman Scampi, better known as Albin Scampi, as Albin also
built them. 30ft, made in Sweden around 40 years ago. Quite light displacement
and meant for racing, but hopefully will serve for cruising. She needs some
work, but overall not a bad deal.</p>

<p>I bought this boat after hitchhiking around Sweden, looking mostly at the Albin
Vega, until Autumn when prices on larger boats like this dropped. I heard
Sweden is a good place to buy a boat, and they certainly do seem cheaper here
than in the UK and probably most of Europe. Swedish boats do not, however,
seem to be well equipped to go to sea, as British ones more often are. I think
this is because they are usually just used around the islands here, so there
is more work to do, like adding anchors, tender, vhf radio!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5570/30263959703_fb5e544db7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Oslo City Bike and Brunost" /></p>

<p>Smooth electric trains with good views of fjords.</p>

<p>Everything is clean. Oslo has public slacklines in the city. They are not
broken or vandalised. You can leave bags lying around and they probably won’t
be stolen. It’s like the opposite of Colombia. UK is somewhere inbetween -
closer to Norway, but not as close as I would have thought.</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5786/30863634296_eb6cf477ff_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Aker" /></p>

<p>People play croquet in parks. Someone on benefits can live in a nice flat in a
good part of town, and afford to drink beer, which is about 10GBP / pint. I
am told NAV - the equivalent of the Jobcentre in the UK, are actually nice,
and not trying to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/09/david-clapson-benefit-sanctions-death-government-policies">kill
you</a>. Teslas are charging in the street here too. My cat complains, that
she only has a dingy with an outboard, all her friends had their own
speedboats, which are needed to get around when at the hytta, which could also
be a summer house. Everyone has at least one hytta.</p>

<p>Food is several times more expensive than almost anywhere else, in some cases,
like tacos, about 25x the price in Mexico.  Sprøstekt løk - fried onions - are
tasty. They cost 3 kroner a bag. Nothing else costs less than 10.</p>

<p>The nature is beautiful. It’s not unlike Scotland, but with more sea and
islands and forest, and less rain and grey. One thing I remember is seeing
sunlight reflected off the sea as it was setting, which cast a double shadow
on the rock.</p>

<p>There are lots of boats, and berries. Blueberries everywhere in the
forest. People actually pick them! I think most people in the UK are scared of
food that does not come in plastic.</p>

<p>I’ve still not been to Kenya.</p>

    <link href="https://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/12/Free-Food.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/12/Free-Food</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about getting food for free, that is without spending money, but
actually I mean more than that by free food. Food is the key thing which keeps
many people in slavery. You need it to live (although some people dispute
that) and the current system is set up such that you need to pay for it. This
requires money, which in turn requires you to participate in the economic
system which binds people to jobs they don’t want and generally makes people
so many people miserable. When you know how to get food for free, you become
more free.</p>

<p>I don’t claim that the methods I outline in this post will fix the system or
work if everyone were to do this, but for now they can at least help some of
us.</p>

<h2 id="skipping">Skipping</h2>

<p>In Europe this is called recycling, in America, dumpster diving. The best
places to go are supermarkets at closing time. Huge amounts of good food are
thrown away every day. This might be because an apple is bruised or a banana is
deemed too brown. Much of it will be food that has reached its best before
date. Apart from the fact that these dates are usually very conservative and
therefore the food will probably be good for some time, if you go at closing
time you get food which was on the shelves only minutes earlier, so it may not
even go out of date until the next day. You can live on entirely on what you
find in these bins.</p>

<p>There are some things you will very rarely find, like dried foods and things
with a long shelf life. It’s nice to be able to buy these things, but it’s a
luxury.</p>

<h2 id="growing">Growing</h2>

<p>If you are settled, you can of course grow food. Not much good if you are
travelling though.</p>

<h2 id="foraging">Foraging</h2>

<p>Depending on where you are, you may be able to find fruit, mushrooms, and
other foods growing wild.</p>

<h2 id="asking-in-restaurants-and-shops">Asking in Restaurants and Shops</h2>

<p>This is similar to skipping, but you get it before it is thrown in the
bin. Going to bakeries at closing time is often very worthwhile. Some
restaurants will also cook lots of food that if unsold gets thrown away.</p>

<h2 id="charity">Charity</h2>

<p>There are charities which give food to “the homeless” (whatever that
means). Some temples and churches do this. It is not something I really like
because, unlike skipping, the food has been paid for by someone. I’m not
really comfortable with the idea of other people buying food for me. If you
need it though, you should know these places are there.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Living and Travelling without Money]]></title>
    <link href="https://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/11/Living-for-Free.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/11/Living-for-Free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people assume that travel is expensive, but it doesn’t need to be. I
wintered in the Canary Islands for three months and spent almost nothing. It’s
just a matter of learning how to live without using money. You won’t be
staying in five star hotels all the time, but it is quite possible to be happy
and there are actually many advantages of a money free lifestyle.</p>

<p>Without money, I think you are likely to meet more people, see more of the
places you travel to, and learn more. If you stay in an hotel and go on guided
tours you see the inside of an hotel and meet tourists. Then you come home a
week later because you can’t afford any more and you think you’ve got to do
some job you would rather not be doing right then. If you sleep on a beach, in
a cave, or even on the street you will certainly have a more interesting
experience. You’ll probably meet other travellers or locals who can help you
with things and show you interesting places.</p>

<p>Money forces things. This is maybe ok if you know exactly what you want all
the time, but you probably don’t. The most obvious example is where to go. I
left Edinburgh with the idea of going to Patagonia. If I had bought a flight,
I would have gone straight there. I attempted to hitchhike, and because I was
not successful I had other adventures and learnt and did things which I might
not have otherwise. I think what should have happened did. Things tend to work
out for the best.</p>

<p>I think I’ll write separately about the practicalities of living without
money. The main expenses which need to be removed are accommodation, <a href="/blog/2012/08/12/Free-Food.html">food</a>, and transport. For now I’ll
cover more general ideas.</p>

<h2 id="the-bare-necessities-of-life-will-come-to-you">“The bare necessities of life will come to you.”</h2>

<p>I’ve worked some of this out for myself on my recent travels, but I’m hardly
unique in doing so. First, I’ll tell you a story. I met a guy in Las Palmas
called Toto. He helped me at a lower point with his story.</p>

<p>A few years ago he left home with 20 euros and his bike. Since then he has
travelled round the world. He sailed from Australia to Europe, then to the
Caribbean and back to Europe, and probably other places he didn’t talk
about. He did some busking and when I met him had 100 euros. He didn’t have
any special performing skill, he just did some silly dance. It’s not really
important where he went, the story is that this is possible.</p>

<p>“Even if I only ate bread one day it doesn’t matter, maybe I’ll find something
else the next day.”</p>

<p>I met another guy who makes a bit of money from playing music on the
street. You might call him homeless if you saw him, but since I’ve been back
in Edinburgh working on my geek bike project, he’s been flying all over
Europe. He’s probably happier than most people who work in an office.</p>

<p>It is important to be positive. You’ll be interacting with people for things
like hitchhiking, and people like happy people. “You won’t get a boat with a
sad face.” It’s also important for your own motivation.</p>

<h2 id="the-kindness-of-strangers">The kindness of Strangers</h2>

<p>When I was in the marina one day I went and said hello to some people. After I
short conversation I had to go and buy some food. They said no, you don’t need
to, we have food. I was reluctant to take it from people who may need to more
than me but they insisted and later I found it is not really in short supply.</p>

<p>On La Palma I wanted some sort of shelter to take walking with me in the
wetter Northern part of the island. I mentioned this to someone I had just met
and so within a few minutes of meeting he had lent me his tent and a better
sleeping bag. I nearly skipped over the fact that this happened in a house I
was staying in - where I had been invited to stay by someone else I had just
met. There are many more examples but you’ll need to read them in my other
blov entries when I get round to writing more.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-do-need-money-for">What you do need money for</h2>

<p>Basically, it comes down to convenience and speeding things up. There are a
few things you probably need it for though.</p>

<p>If you want food, you don’t need money. If you want something particular to
eat, you’ll probably need to buy it. If you want something now, you need to
buy it. If you can wait until you find it in a skip, you don’t. If you have
time to hitchhike, you’ll get there in the end. If you want to go now, you
have to pay for a bus. Of course, if you don’t know where you are going,
hitchhiking is better anyway.</p>

<p>Things you pretty much do need money for are transport, some foods, and
medicines. Sometimes you might need to pay for transport: a ferry, for
example. It’s very rare to find certain things in a bin, e.g. alcohol, coffee,
cooking oil, dried foods, and things with a long sell by date, but you can
live without these.</p>

<p>This post is rather unfocused because I have a lot to say on this subject and
I’m just trying to get some ideas out for now. Hopefully it is enough to show
you that this is possible. If you go out into the world with nothing but a
good attitude and an open mind you’ll probably do very well.</p>

<p>I’ll end with a particularly impressive story from a friend, and a link to
another blog post about this sort of thing, “<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18463814">The
Universe Is Conspiring to Help Us”.</a></p>

  <p>“The magic is FULL ON when u arrive in a city and we have no where to sleep
