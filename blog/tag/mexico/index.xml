    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cancun is a tourist resort. It's made of hotels. It doesn't seem quite as bad
as Maspalomas - there are some areas where people live, but it's still not
somewhere I would like to spend much time. It was hard to find any food that
would not make me feel sick. Maybe there are good parts but I felt I had to
get out of there before I went mad.</p>

<p>I took the bus, as crazyguyonabike blogs told me the only routes out were big
boring roads. Cycling to the bus was quite exciting - mostly busses and
collectivos on the dual carridgeway. Large roundabouts and weird junctions I
had not seen before. The general idea seems to be to drive on the right but
overtaking is done on whichever side is convenient.</p>

<p>Putting the bike on the bus was trivial. Did not even need to remove
panniers. Far superior service to busses i n the UK.</p>

<p>My bike felt like a bus. Total weight of bike and gear was 55kg when I left
Manchester. The ADO bus, when I was on it, rolled along with a similar
feeling.</p>
