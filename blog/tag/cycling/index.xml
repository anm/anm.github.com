    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For my geek bike project I needed to choose some fastenings to make the solar
panel mount, and also for attaching carrier racks to the frame.</p>

<p>The choice is quite important and I have had problems with them before. On my
last tour one of the bolts attaching the rear carrier to the frame fell out. I
had to remove another one of these to fit the solar panel and almost couldn't
because it had rusted solid.</p>

<h2>Size</h2>

<p>The brazeons on my bike are M5 threads. This is the same as used in my SPD
shoes, which saved me when I lost one last time, so I'm standardising on M5.</p>

<h2>Drive</h2>

<p>I want something common so I don't need special tools and can find tools if I
need to. This means slot, cross / phillips, or hex / allan key. Slot and cross
heads can be deformed too easily - hex gives much more torque and is harder to
damage. This is important if the bolt gets stuck.</p>

<h2>Head shape</h2>

<p>Some hex socket screws have a rounded off head and some are cylindrical. The
later kind could be gripped with pliers if the socket was damaged so I favour
these.</p>

<h2>Material</h2>

<p>For strength I think it has to be some sort of steel. The options are zinc
plated, galvanised or stainless steel. Hot dip galvanisation gives too thick a
layer of zinc for threads of this size, so the real options are zinc plated or
stainless.</p>

<p>The screws in my rack which have rusted solid were zinc plated. Clearly this
is inadequate unless you constantly attend to them by oiling and
replacment. That leaves stainless steel. The specific grade of stainless steel
is probably irrelevent for this application.</p>

<h2>Galvanic corrosion</h2>

<p>There is a possible problem with stainless though. When dissimilar metals are
in contact in the presence of water they form an electrical cell which
oxidises the less noble metal. My bike frame is made of aluminium, which is
less noble than stainless steel but more noble than zinc. Stainless steel
risks corroding the frame whereas zinc plated screws would not. According to
the British Stainless Steel Association, the <a
href="http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=89">risk of problems</a> from
a small amount of stainless in contact with a larger piece of aluminium is
quite low. Additionally, galvanic corrosion is only a problem if the parts are
wet, and particularly with salt water. Most of the time I expect to be touring
in warm dry weather (this is an advantage of being able to move all the time)
so the risk seems quite low. Nevertheless, I could reduce this risk my adding
some sacrificial zinc somewhere. An easy way to do this would be to use zinc
plated washers.</p>

<h2>Locking</h2>

<p>As well as the carrier bolt which fell out, in testing my solar panel mount
around town I lost another screw. I suspect this is because of the vibration,
particularly from hard tyres I like to reduce rolling resistance.</p>

<p>The one which came out used a nyloc nut but the bolt was very short so it
might not have reached the plastic. I think I will use nyloc again with the
correct size of bolt and also use threadlock. I would like to use copper
grease to avoid seizing but I'm not sure about how to use this and threadlock.</p>

<p>Someone told me you can use nail polish instead of threadlock. Presumably
threadlock is better, but I don't know. I also found the <a
href="http://www.thunderboltrc.com/tutorials/tutorial_six.html">idea</a> when
searching about this to use nail polish to indictade movement of the bolt -
put it accross bolt and other part and it will crack if the bolt turns.</p>

<p>The value of lock washers seems to be debatable, so I think I won't use them
for now.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The ANM standard bolt is an M5, cylindrical hex socket head, stainless
steel. It should be used with threadlock, stainless nyloc nut and plain
stainless or zinc plated washers.</p>

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/26/Music-Hack-Day-Scotland.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/26/Music-Hack-Day-Scotland</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend saw a music hack day in Edinburgh. I signed up with a couple of
ideas of things I might do but I wasn't really sure if I'd get much done. In
the end my hack was quite successful and I won an iPad!</p>

<p>One idea I had was to make a virtual <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_bowl">Singing Bowl</a> using a wire
and capacitive touch sensing. I thought this would be quite difficult because
to do it at all well would probably require quite a sophisticated sensor,
something like used in <a
href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_botanicus_drp.htm">Disney's
interactive plant project</a>.</p>

<p>My other, which I built, was related to my touring bike. I was thinking about
what to call my new bike when I get her, and I think I might choose <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_(Doctor_Who)">River
Song</a>. The bike is for open ended touring without any particular rush to
get anywhere. It is for living. I like the idea of the bike flowing through
life, time and space.</p>

<p>Make the bike sing.</p>

<p>This gave me the idea that she ought to have a song. I wanted something to
represent movement and flow. The most obvious idea was the sound of a river. I
could also have tried to compose something but that seemed more difficult
because it would require musical ability. I decided to make river sounds.</p>

<p>I wanted the sound to change with movement. The simplest thing is to take the
current speed. I also thought about using distance traveled recently
(i.e. adding integral action to the music controller). I considered modeling
a water system, such that movement caused rainfall, which then soaked through
the ground and eventually reached the river. For this hack, I kept it simple
and used only speed.</p>

<p><img
src="/res/2012-08-26-Music-Hack-Day-Scotland/river-song-block-diagram.png"
alt="Block diagram of system."
title="The unicycle is not actually radially spoked." /></p>

<p>Above is a diagram of the system I demonstrated. I used a unicycle rather than
a bike for the demo because it was easier to get it into the lecture theatre
and turn the wheel. I'll now discuss the design choices.</p>

<p>I considered two ways of making the sound. One was synthesising from scratch,
and the other using samples. I realised that I actually had recordings of a
river and of water flowing in a pipe, the later which I took when walking on
La Palma. I chose to use synthesis because it seemed like it would be easier
to modify the sound with data and it made it more hackable for future changes
to the sound.</p>

<p>I had never done any sound synthesis before so I didn't know what software I
should use. I thought about using a library for some programming language I
already knew but decided to try using something designed for sound. The main
contenders seemed to be SuperCollider and Pure Data. Asking around I found
Pure Data seems to be the most popular, and this was confirmed at the
presentation when I saw several hacks used it.</p>

<p>Pure Data was difficult to get started with, and I almost gave up. The
documentation is very poor and the Ubuntu package had various things wrong
with it, like the sound test not working. I managed to get it working in the
end. I didn't have time to learn much about the language never mind actually
designing synthesisers and sounds but I found a Pure Data patch which made
something which sounded like running water. Random hacking at this discovered
a place where I could change a value to make the water sound more violent. I
used this and also increased the volume when the bike went faster.</p>

<p>To detect movement I used a magnet on the wheel and a reed switch from an old
bike computer. This I connected to an Arduino (actually <a
href="/blog/2011/05/25/Arduino-Getting-started-with-Seeeduino.html">Seeeduino</a>)
which measured the time between switch pulses and sent this over a USB serial
connection to a laptop running Pure Data.</p>

<p>In Pure Data, I used the comport module to receive data from the serial
port. This was also not well documented but I worked it out from some blog
posts.</p>

<p>I finished soldering connectors together about 10 minutes before the
presentations were meant to start and then ran to the event. I was tweaking
the sensor position and patch parameters during the talks but soldering proper
connectors paid off because there was no trouble - amazingly the thing
actually worked at a demonstration! I was now on stage with a unicycle, so of
course I had to try and ride it. I managed to idle briefly and long enough to
trigger the sensor, so overall successful.</p>

<p>I would have been quite pleased at that, but then there were prizes, and I won
an iPad! I'm not sure what to do with it yet. Maybe duck tape it to my
bike. :)</p>

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/04/Coderace.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2012/08/04/Coderace</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img width="640" src="http://www.coderace.co.uk/images/Event2012/Screenshot2.jpg" alt="Final game map" /></p>

<p>Today I participated in an event called <a
href="http://www.coderace.co.uk/">Coderace</a> with a team from the <a
href="http://edinburghhacklab.com/">Edinburgh Hacklab</a>.</p>

<p>The game used an Android app which showed points on a map. Each point had a
clue which could be answered using information available at the indicated
location, for example text on a sculpture or building. Cycling was recommend,
and all but one of us did. A car was used to reach the furthest points.</p>

<p>There were only two teams. The hacklab won 18 to 4, which was amusing because
we were not regular cyclists and the other team had people dressed up
as road racers.</p>

<p>It was sunny and ideal conditions for cycling. There were problems with the
application crashing, position tracking failing, and with phones but it mostly
worked. It was a good way to get some exercise and an idea of what can be done
with these devices. Thanks to Napier University for running it.</p>

<p><img width="640" src="http://www.coderace.co.uk/images/Event2012/DSC00459.JPG" alt="Bikes
and phones" /></p>

<p>I borrowed a phone for the game. My normal phone is a Sony Ericsson W800i and I
had never really used a smartphone before. I had been thinking about a general
purpose computing interface for my touring bike so it was interesting to try
an Android phone as this was one of the main ideas. I borrowed a Samsung
Galaxy S II (GT-I9100).</p>

<p>There were several problems, which without changing things make this system
rather poor. I could hardly see the screen in sunlight. My O2 connection only
allowed 50MB per day, and offered no option to pay for more. This was used in
1.5 hours of occasional map usage. I would think navigation with moving map
is a standard use case for these devices so clearly the limit is not enough
for normal use. The battery was also nearly flat after 1.5 hours, from a near
full charge. The battery in this phone is tiny compared to the screen size. It
seems that a solar or dynamo charging system is not just needed for extend off
grid operation but even when used in a city.</p>

<p>Mobile networks still don't get it when it comes to data. It used to be that
they charged about £3/MB, which is as good as infinite. I suspect what
happened is they had the idea people would want to use WAP and they made up a
price such that the per page cost was what they wanted. This of course made
the tariff useless for actual web browsing. I thought that with the
introduction of smart phones they would have sorted this out but although it's
an order of magnitude less bad it needs another two. The most they offer if
pre arranged is 1GB / month for £10.</p>

<p>And if you want to use it to navigate when cycling through more than one
country you can forget it - back to £3/MB, or something on the order of £1000
/ day. It would be possible if the maps are preloaded but still you can see
the situation is ridiculous.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the unusually good weather required me to take the bike out for
a spin. I took some photos and video of the station while I was
out. It's described in more detail in <a rel="start"

1</a>.</p>

<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390"

<p>Pay no attention to the audio behind the wind-noise - I think all I
said was that I was using the FT-817 and 5W.</p>

<p><img

<p>15m 1/4 wave and 2 J-Pole. The latter is held together with masking
tape - I'll need to fix that better as well. Two sections of pole is
the minimum for the J-Pole. Three sections seems to be ok on most
roads. Four sections, as shown here, hits trees on some roads. It is
no higher than a bus though so should be ok on main roads.</p>

<p>The ground tuning capacitor. Red goes to coax braid, yellow to frame.</p>

<p>Everything survived being bashed down the back of the hill, where
there are now steps, some of which I rode over. Low trees ripped off
the J-Pole though.</p>

    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/03/21/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This evening I tested the antenna system described in my <a
rel="prev" href="/blog/2011/03/19/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-1.html">last
post</a>, as well as a 2m J-pole.</p>

<p>Immediately on leaving the house I was answered on 2m by GM8OTI. This
was an unexpectedly good start - most often when I have tried 2m bike
radio I get nothing. The J-Pole was probably much better than previous
antennas and he said he had seen my post on SOTA watch so was
expecting me. I extended only one section of the mast for the journey,
which was just enough for the J-pole.</p>

<iframe style="" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0"
scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"
src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=&amp;sll=55.982293,-3.196529&amp;sspn=0.000407,0.00121&amp;gl=uk&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=55.982313,-3.196528&amp;spn=0.000263,0.00057&amp;z=20&amp;output=embed"></iframe>


<p>I planned to operate in the vicinity of Newhaven Lighthouse in the
hope that proximity to sea water would provide a good ground
plane. When I arrived at the lighthouse I could start operating very
quickly as I only had to extend the mast. This is in contrast to the
usual faff of setting up for <a href="/sota">SOTA</a> which involves guy lines.</p>

<p>The band (15 meters) sounded dead - I heard no stations at all. I
thought conditions must be bad but I tried calling CQ anyway and,
although rather slow, I got some results!</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Time</th> <th>f</th> <th>Station</th><th>Sent</th> <th>Received</th></tr>
<tr><td>~1830</td> <td>145.500</td> <td>GM8OTI</td> <td>59</td> <td>59-57</td></tr>
<tr><td>~1915</td> <td>21.280</td>  <td>GM8OTI</td> <td>21</td> <td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>1929</td>  <td>21.280</td>  <td>KA1ANW</td> <td>57</td> <td>57</td> </tr>
<tr><td>1942</td>  <td>21.280</td>  <td>WD8BEY</td> <td>59</td> <td>59</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007</td>  <td>21.315</td>  <td>N8YHY</td>  <td>58</td> <td>59? Did not note</td></tr>
<tr><td>2009</td>  <td>21.290</td>  <td>C06LC</td>  <td>59</td> <td>59</td></tr>
</table>


<p>I had never heard the CO prefix before but didn't think much of it
until I got home and looked it up. QRZ.com tells me C06LC is in Cuba,
4441 miles away. I think voltage was down to about 10V or less at this
point so I probably wasn't even using the nominal 5W I usually
claim. I think that is my furthest contact - QRP or otherwise. It's at
least 888 miles / watt and probably over 1000.</p>

<p><img class="centre"

width="480" height="640" alt="Newhaven Lighthouse" title="Newhaven
Lighthouse" /></p>

<p>Effectiveness varied greatly with location. Near the lighthouse
was good but when I tried moving north west along the coast it was far
worse. I heard N8YHY at S1 - when I moved back to the lighthouse it
increased to S8.</p>

<p>I spent some time after these contacts listening on bands from 160m to
10m. I was surprised to hear stations on 160 meters with my short
antenna - one who sounded English on SSB and several morse which I
didn't try and decode. I also tried adding a miracle whip tuner. I
think it tuned on 17m and 20m but battery was now flat so could not
test properly.</p>

<p>It was generally a pleasant evening - warm and dry but windy. The sky
was clear giving good star display and a shooting star. There were
some very good photos I would like to have taken - with railings, bike
and mast in the foreground, lighthouse beyond that and stars behind -
but my camera phone was not up to the job. I was not, on this
occasion, questioned by police or public about my unusual activities,
nor about the fact my bike had wires on it. As we now know, <a
href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i_pDxEAYSiWgBNlLs8ALAyGID7Lw">wires
are evil</a> unless they come in a box with the name of a big company
on it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I declare this operation successful and intend to
experiment further.</p>

<h3>Solar Data</h3>


<p> For future reference / comparison, the solar data
from N0NBH for this evening (2115 UTC I think it was but I can't find
historical data to check) was:</p>

<p>SFI 101
SN 47
A-Index 3
K-Index 1</p>

<p>15 meter conditions were pronounced to be fair.</p>

    <updated>2011-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/03/19/HF-Bicycle-Mobile-Experiment-Part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to make an HF antenna for my bike. I did an experiment
with this once last year but it was not terribly successful. That
experiment used the <a href="http://www.g4ilo.com/atx.html">ATX
antenna</a>. No contacts were made but I learned something about
grounding.</p>

<p>I decided to use the frame as a ground. <a
href="http://www.qrz.com/callsign/G4AKC">G4AKC</a> says that this can
be improved by tuning the frame. I found that with a variable capacitor
in series with the frame I could adjust for low SWR with the ATX set
up as in the instructions. I can't remember what bands I tried it on.</p>

<p>The primary aim this time was to improve the ground. Last time, I had
a very temporary setup with croc clips to the frame so I decided to
improve it with fixed wires. I cleaned and sanded around a bolt on the
carrier and two brazons on the frame and connected the points with
some mains wire. I also attached a flexible wire to connect to the
antenna system.</p>

<p>While I was pondering how best to connect the aerial and earth with
the very limited selection of BNC parts I had I decided I might as
well make a proper antenna, which would make this easier. I took some
of the sections of the fishing pole I use for SOTA and duct taped them
to the carrier. The longest I thought I could reasonably get away with
was 4m which is what I used. I decided to use the lowest HF band I
could with the given antenna space, as the higher bands seem to be
open far less often, so I decided on a 1/4 wave for the 21MHz band.</p>

<p>I started with 3.5m of wire and found the tuning was way off. I
decided to try and tune it against a good earth so I drove in an earth
stake. This actually made it slightly worse. I then laid out three
radials and tried various combinations before giving up on finding an
improvement. I then started trying to tune to what I had. I had to cut
away quite a lot of wire but got the SWR down to 1.1. This was with
the capacitor in series with the frame.</p>

<p>I tied a SLAB to the carrier and put the FT-817 in the bar bag and set
off for a maiden voyage. The SWR remained constant despite shaking,
moving of antenna and presumably different ground, although I did only
go around the block. I could hear several American stations and one in
Africa but my CQs were not answered. Eventually though, some
unexpected success! I replied to N8RA in Connecticut and received a
(contest) 59. He had no trouble copying my callsign first time so it
must have been a reasonable signal. I tried for a while longer but
with no further contacts so stopped for the day.</p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>


<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Other bands - I think I can fit in 17m and 10m may be useful now too.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace top section of fibreglass and wire with bendy steel
wire. This should reduce wind resistance, weight and effect of
crashing into trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Try other earth tuning arrangements. Measure earth current -
possibly with a clip on ferrite transformer I got from the
electricity company.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical improvement - replace duct tape. I require a system
for easy removal, connection and disconnection. Must also be
weather, oil and dirt proof. Should not reduce load carrying
capacity of rack - needs to stay out the way of panniers.</p></li>
</ul>
