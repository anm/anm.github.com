    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I could feel something today. Some energy in the air, like something was going
to happen. Everyone could feel it. The wind was building and shaking the
trees. It had been building for days.</p>

<p>The wind drove us to eat in a huddle in the camp, sensibly breaking the
protocol of eating in the exposed, sandblasted, main circle. It felt like a
tribe coming together in the face of adversity. It was. The wind blew all
night and bounced my hammock.</p>

<p>The next morning, I broke up with my girlfriend. We were sitting in camp. As I
was talking, something hit me in the back. A girl sat up in my hammock. My now
ex-gf left to make her own camp, and I talked to my friend.</p>

<p>She was sleeping there, she told me, on account of being very tired from the
previous night's activity. She had sex with a guy she liked, and the girl he
was with. She felt very free now. Free from jealousy, ego and social
limits. It sounds like it was a very liberating experience, and a cleansing
from the past. Past problems blown away with the wind.</p>

<p>Later, I was dwelling on the past. As I was thinking about what went wrong
with the gf, ruminating, a pan whacked me on the head. Stop it! Be present
now! The wind had blown it from the tree.</p>

<p>That night, there was an orange glow in the distance. With the wind coming
from there, it was not long before it brought the fire to the camp. Everyone
was driven out. Anything left behind was burnt. Many people lost things,
attachments maybe, and many moved on that morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had this idea that slacklining would be more fun if the line was on fire. I
googled it and couldn't find any references to people trying it before, so I
decided to experiment.</p>

<p>Kevlar wick is used to make fire toys like staffs and poi and I thought this
should be pretty strong. I mentioned this to Greg, who just happened to be
ordering some wick. It was obvious we had to try it.</p>

<p>A slackline needs some bounce though and wick is not stretchy, so we took my
slackline and tied the wick to it with a tape knot. The wick then went through
a ratchet to tension the system. The line made concerning creaking sounds as
it was tensioned. We poured paraffin on the middle of the line and water on the
ends.</p>

<p>By this point we had quite a crowd standing around. We got the line lit and I
prepared to walk it.</p>

<p>We debated what to wear. I wasn't sure which would be better: bare feet and
shorts or relatively fire resistant natural fibres and leather boots. I can
touch burning wicks without being burnt so I think it would be ok barefoot as
long as one does not hang around for too long. I decided though to try it with
boots and denim trousers first. I also had someone on each side standing by
with fire blankets.</p>

<p>As I stepped up onto the line, it snapped. :-( Interestingly it did not break
at the ratchet, but in the middle where it was burning. It seems it may have
been weakened by the fire, because I could stand on it before it was lit.</p>

<p>I need to work out some way to make a system like this which is strong
enough. Otherwise I might need to try the fire unicycle idea. Hm.</p>

<p>I entertained myself for the rest of the night by juggling flaming torches and
spinning things.</p>
