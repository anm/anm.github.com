    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had this idea that slacklining would be more fun if the line was on fire. I
googled it and couldn't find any references to people trying it before, so I
decided to experiment.</p>

<p>Kevlar wick is used to make fire toys like staffs and poi and I thought this
should be pretty strong. I mentioned this to Greg, who just happened to be
ordering some wick. It was obvious we had to try it.</p>

<p>A slackline needs some bounce though and wick is not stretchy, so we took my
slackline and tied the wick to it with a tape knot. The wick then went through
a ratchet to tension the system. The line made concerning creaking sounds as
it was tensioned. We poured paraffin on the middle of the line and water on the
ends.</p>

<p>By this point we had quite a crowd standing around. We got the line lit and I
prepared to walk it.</p>

<p>We debated what to wear. I wasn't sure which would be better: bare feet and
shorts or relatively fire resistant natural fibres and leather boots. I can
touch burning wicks without being burnt so I think it would be ok barefoot as
long as one does not hang around for too long. I decided though to try it with
boots and denim trousers first. I also had someone on each side standing by
with fire blankets.</p>

<p>As I stepped up onto the line, it snapped. :-( Interestingly it did not break
at the ratchet, but in the middle where it was burning. It seems it may have
been weakened by the fire, because I could stand on it before it was lit.</p>

<p>I need to work out some way to make a system like this which is strong
enough. Otherwise I might need to try the fire unicycle idea. Hm.</p>

<p>I entertained myself for the rest of the night by juggling flaming torches and
spinning things.</p>
