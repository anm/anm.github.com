    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has a municipal bike system, but registering for it
is rather complicated and especially difficult if you don’t live here and
understand Spanish, so I decide to write a guide, as I have just done it. The
system is available to non-residents.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-get">What you get</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can pick up a bike at any point and return it to any other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can keep the bike out for up to one hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After returning, you need to wait 15 minutes to use one again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can borrow a bike up to three times per day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Rental is done with a smartcard or a phone app.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-costs">What it Costs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.50 EUR for the smart card, which also can be used for busses. Usage is
free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly various fees if you are late returning the bike or lose the bike,
don’t report them as damaged…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-register">How to Register</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fill in this
<a href="http://www.bybikelpa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=85&amp;lang=en">form</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will receive two emails. Ignore the first.  In the second email, click
the link “HAGA CLICK AQUÍ”.  This takes you to a form which asks for your
Spanish tax number. You don’t need one. What you actually should enter here
is your passport or ID document number that you put in the last form. Follow
the process for verifying phone number. (You must receive a text message.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait for 24 to 48 hours, then go to one of the registration offices with
your passport or ID. A few offices are listed in the emails you are sent,
but I actually went to San Telmo bus station, which was not listed but
worked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a BONOGUAGUA smart card for 1.50 EUR. It is yellow. At San Telmo, you
can do this at the ticket office with the glass window, in a corner. I think
you can also do it at a machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the ByBike / Bus office. At San Telmo, this is the larger office you
can walk into, to the right of the glass ticket office booth. Give them your
ID, yellow card, and say you want to register for ByBike. “Quiero
registrarme para ByBike”. They will look you up on the computer. If you
waited long enough since the last step, they will validate it and that
should be other. Otherwise it might still be “pendiente” - come back later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should now be able to use the bikes!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-bikes">Using the Bikes</h2>

<p>You can use the card, or a mobile app. The app shows where stations are, and
how many bikes and spaces are at each place. You can also take a bike out
without the card at most stations.</p>

<p>For the app (optional):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Download the app:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usualbike.bybikeLPA">Android</a>
or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/bybike-lpa/id975121273?mt=8">iOS</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Login with username and password that you will receive in a third email,
after your ID is validated at the office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a screenshot of the map while you still have internet, because the app
does not work at all offline.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
