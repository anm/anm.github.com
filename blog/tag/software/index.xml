    <content type="html"><![CDATA[My highest score at <a href="http://nyan.cat">nyan.cat</a> was achieved when
programming. I was at work and struggling to get much done. Then I put on
nyan cat and within a few hours I had resolved several issues. I guessed it
might be helping because it occupied the part of my brain that usually would be
free to distract me by generating unrelated thoughts.

I also like to listen to <a
href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psytrance">psytrance</a> music when
programming. I thought it was good because it is simple and repetitive, so
unlikely to be distracting. It's also fast and good for keeping me awake for
long hacking sessions.

Meditation also can help to clear the mind of unwanted thoughts and aid
concentration. I think this state of focus is what some programmers call flow.

I suspect now that trance music and meditation probably produce similar mental
states, which aid concentration and getting things done. I therefore recommend
that offices should play repetitive music such as nyan cat to boost
productivity and increase moral. :) I also recommend hacking at psytrance
parties.

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/09/11/Native-Mobile-Web-Apps-with-PhoneGap.html"/>
    <updated>2011-09-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/09/11/Native-Mobile-Web-Apps-with-PhoneGap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I was having a play with CSS 3D transforms and I made a <a
href="/blog/2011/08/08/Torchwood-Triangle-with-CSS-3D-Transforms.html">spinning
triangle symbol</a> as seen on the TV show Torchwood. Last night, someone
tweeted me about it saying he wanted a version for his phone. I'd done some
mobile web app development before (my <a href="/life/life.html">HTML5 Game of
Life</a>) but had never made a native app. Learning native app development was
not my top priority but I knew it was possible to make native apps using HTML
and Javascript so thought I would try it.

## Mobile Web Apps and Native Apps

Native apps are written to a device specific API and use a device specific
runtime and packaging system. This means they must be rewritten for every
platform which is required. They are not a part of the web. This means that
their resources cannot be linked to, for example.

Mobile web apps use standard web technologies. They can run on many different
platforms and interoperate with the rest of the web. They are created in much
the same way as a normal web app but they can be designed to also work
offline. The key technology to enable this is the HTML5 offline application
cache. Further enhancements can be made to make mobile web apps look like
native apps, for example providing an icon to use when installing the app in a
home screen.

I believe that whenever possible mobile web apps should be used in preference
to native apps. This is because:

- They are mostly cross platform.
- You don't need to learn a totally different development ecosystem and, in
  the case of iOS, Objective-C.
- They interoperate with the web. Does not need to silo data, can be linked to.
- Morally better: they reduce wasted time redoing work for other
  platforms. This is time developers could be using to be creating something
  new to benefit the world.

Mobile web apps have some disadvantages though:

- Users are less familiar with them: this may reduce installs and they may not
  understand they can be used offline.
- Not all device features are available through the DOM, e.g. a phone camera.
- Payment infrastructure: The Apple App Store, for example, makes it easy to
  sell apps.

Thankfully, there is a way to develop using web standards as far as possible
and then bundle the functionality in a native app. This preserves some of the
benefits of web apps, such as reduced development time for many platforms,
allows the apps to be included in app stores, and permits access to device
features.

There are many frameworks designed to do just this - here is wikipedia's list:
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_phone_web_based_application_framework">Mobile
web based application frameworks</a>.

## Using PhoneGap

I decided to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhoneGap">PhoneGap</a>
for the Torchwood triangle project. This is something that could be
done as a web app, in fact <a href="/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/">I did
that too</a>, but I wanted to learn about the technology.

If I had needed to use features not available to web apps, I could have done
so with PhoneGap. It adds javascript objects to the DOM to provide additional
features, for example, here is how to <a
href="http://docs.phonegap.com/phonegap_camera_camera.md.html">access a
camera</a>.

First, I had to install the Android SDK. I also installed the eclipse plugins
as the documentation suggested this would probably be the quickest way to get
started. I usually prefer to work with emacs and the command line but this
dealt with generating the boilerplate. I then downloaded and copied the
necessary parts of PhoneGap to the project. This was all straightforward,
following the <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/start#android">PhoneGap getting
started guide</a>.

I then copied my html, css and image to the project and ran it in the
simulator. It was very slow to start, and failed with an error the first time
but it did eventually work.

### Packaging

I now had an Android application which worked in the simulator. I now had to
work out how to package it and get it onto real devices. The android
developers guide <a
href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/preparing.html">publishing
section</a> was helpful at this stage.

Some points to note:

- Signing applications is mandatory but is typically done with a self signed
  key you create yourself.
- <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/versioning.html">Set
  versions</a> correctly.
- Remove unneeded permissions from <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.
- Optimise performance by using <a
  href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/zipalign.html">zipalign</a>.

### Distribution

I now had a <code>.apk</code> file but I wasn't sure how these could be
distributed. I tested in the emulator and found that they can simply be
downloaded with a web browser and the device offers to install the app. The
usual way to do it is probably to upload to the Android Marketplace but unlike
the Apple equivalent this is not required.

The only problem I had now was that I don't actually have an Android device!
I'll try and get someone to test it out for me tomorrow but here is the
possibly working app for you to try just now: <a
href="/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/Torchwood_Triangle.apk">Torchwood
Triangle for Android</a>.

Update: I'm afraid the Android app doesn't show the triangle. See further
comments on <a

<p>
I was watching Torchwood this evening when for some reason the spinning
triangle suddenly made me think of CSS 3D transforms. I had to do it.

<p>
The triangle is an inline svg. CSS specifies that transitions should be done
smoothly over time. Javascript pokes the triangle every two seconds to rotate
it. Requires webkit for now.

<h3>Update: A better version and Mobile Apps</h3>

Here is a version on its own page, with correct
colours: <a href="http://mm0hai.net/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/">Torchwood

<h4>iPhone / iOS</h4>

The same version can also be installed as an iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) app,
although it seems to be rather
temperamental. Visit <a href="http://mm0hai.net/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/">the
page</a> on your iOS device then press the bookmark button and select "Add to
Home Screen".

<h4>Android</h4>

I've also turned it into
a <a href="/misc/torchwood-spinning-triangle/Torchwood_Triangle.apk">native
Android App</a>. I have no idea if this works - I have never made an Android
app before and I don't even have a device to test it on! I'll be very
surprised and pleased to hear if it does work. If so, I might make a better
version and put it on the Android Marketplace.

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/07/31/Haskell-List-Comprehensions.html"/>
    <updated>2011-07-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/07/31/Haskell-List-Comprehensions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Why they're so good
-------------------

I like list comprehensions. They are concise. Until recently though, I did not
know why. Reading <a
href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/craft2e">Thompson</a>, I
realised it is because they combine three fundamental patterns of functional
programming with little syntax. The patterns are generate, filter, and map.

The generation stage produces one or more lists, often using something like
`[1..]`, the list of the natural numbers.  Filters are specified as comma
separated boolean expressions.  The map operation is defined before the `|`.
There is some more detail in the <a
href="http://haskell.org/onlinereport/exps.html#list-comprehensions">Haskell
Report</a>.

They're not set builder
-----------------------

It's tempting to think of list comprehensions as set builder notation, which
clearly they are meant to resemble. The problem is they are not and thinking
of them this way can lead to problems when it is time to evaluate them.

Obviously, they are lists, not sets. This will restrict how they are evaluated
- order matters. It's also unhelpful if you really do want a set but the way
you write the list comprehension generates some values more than once.

How you write them matters
--------------------------

Pure functions are (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensionality">extensionally</a>) equal if
the outputs are the same for all inputs. When there are several ways to write
the same function, a perfect compiler would know the most efficient way to
calculate each result. Unfortunately, it seems that GHC is not perfect and there
are in practice dramatic differences in execution time depending on how
functions are written.

For example, when solving Project Euler problem 9, I wrote something a bit
like this:

<pre><code>
slow n = [ (a, b, c) | a <- [1..n], b <- [1..n], c <- [1..n], 
          (a + b + c) == n ]
</code></pre>
Which is equal to this in result:
<pre><code>
fast n = [ (a, b, c) | a <- [1..n], b <- [1..n], let c = n - (a + b), 
          (a + b + c) == n ]
</code></pre>

but not in execution time. For n = 1000, fast took less than a second and slow
did not complete within minutes.

I would guess GHC is using nested loops, so slow will have time complexity
`O(n^3)` and fast `O(n^2)`.

Well, I think it shows up on hacker news less often than Mongo so the main
reason I know about it is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/daleharvey/">Dale
Harvey</a>. Dale works for <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>
and is sometimes seen wearing his CouchDB t-shirt in Appleton Tower, hub of <a

work.

He's <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/16244683">spoken about CouchDB</a> at
Edinburgh's Tech Meetup. Most of the rest of what I know about Couch has come
from Dale while in the pub.

What's the point of this post? Have a good ambassador. How do you get them?
Make something hackers like. It probably helps to do it in a fun language like
Erlang.

    <updated>2011-07-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/07/18/MongoDB-Marketing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I read <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> frequently and
was generally aware of NoSQL databases. I had a feeling I should learn at
least one of them but did not have a real plan to do so yet. Partly, this was
because I hadn't decided which one would be the best investment of time.

<img class="float-left rounded"
src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5955214301_56dfd34107_m.jpg"
width="200" height="195" alt="MongoDB Mug"> Then, one day, I found myself in
the middle of a MongoDB tutorial and using a live database. What? How did that
happen? I had <a
href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-accidentally">accidentally</a> the
MongoDB. I note I also have a MongoDB mug - I don't even know exactly where it
came from.

This got me thinking about the marketing of open source products and how in
this case it had been done so successfully. Looking back, there are many
things people had done to get me to this point.

First, MongoDB showed up often on hacker news. In particular, this <a
href="http://www.mongly.com/tutorial/index">interactive tutorial</a>
appeared. I thought it looked interesting and clicked it despite not really
planning to do a tutorial at this stage. Instead of instructions to download
and install packages, run commands and copy code in a webpage, I was presented
with an initially rather bare screen. Within a few seconds though instructions
started to appear. I was told "It's easy, just enter
<code>db.getCollectionNames();</code>" How could I not do something so simple?

From there, the tutorial progressed, building up to more interesting tasks,
each slightly more complicated than the last. This method of using small
prompts avoids overwhelming the user and draws one in. After doing one or two,
I kept going to see what interesting feature I would discover next. There were
puzzles to solve and immediate feedback.

Where did this tutorial come from? Well it was made by <a
href="http://openmymind.net/about">Karl Seguin</a>. Why? I don't know but
presumably he enjoyed using it and could see that Mongo was something people
were interested in learning. He may well have thought that because of hacker
news activity. Maybe he wanted to get a job.

That's an important reason why someone may want to learn a technology - to get
a job at a company that uses it. If the sort of companies that hackers like
(startups doing something exciting) are using your software then hackers will
be more likely to be interested in it and promote it for you in things like
their blog posts. The moral would seem to be solve problems cool companies
have. This is related to Paul Graham's <a
href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html">Startup Ideas We'd Like to Fund</a>
"30. Startups for startups".

So why does Mongo show up so much on hacker news to start with? I suspect it
is largely because it is a good product. It is the sort of thing hackers enjoy
using. It is probably also something to do with <a
href="http://www.10gen.com/team">the 10gen team</a> making an effort not just
to develop it but to promote it. Note how many people have the words
"marketing" or "community" in their blurb. Compare Couchbase, which only lists
leadership and technical teams. Marketing is mentioned only once on the
leadership page.

Compare the <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and <a
href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> websites.  Couch has fairly dense
text (although I do like the architecture diagram up front) whereas Mongo is
rather prettier. Also note the "Try it out" button at the top of the Mongo
page, leading to a shell.

Compare also the websites of <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>
and <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a>, companies which support Couch
and Mongo respectively. 10gen has "Download" and "Learn" buttons. Couchbase
has, ironically, only marketing speak.

So what have I learnt from this? Make your product hacker friendly. If people
like it they will promote it for you. Make it ridiculously easy to start
learning it. Let people know what it does quickly, with a well designed
website.

As for the mug, it must have come from a conference someone in the office went
to. I would like to think this would not change my opinion on what makes a
good database but we know it does.]]></content>

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/07/17/Learning-Haskell-1.html"/>
    <updated>2011-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/07/17/Learning-Haskell-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I'm learning Haskell at the moment, and have been doing so slowly over the
past couple of months.

I know many languages to some extent but have never really practiced
functional programming seriously. I am familiar with some of the concepts,
which I have picked up from languages with functional aspects, such as perl
(see <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com">Higher Order Perl</a>) and
javascript, from speaking to a more knowledgeable friend and of course from
wikipedia. I also started to learn common lisp a few years ago and got as far
as reading most of a book before having to do something else. (University
work. It was quite good at getting in the way of me learning things.)

I decided to have another go at learning functional programming properly. It
is an important programming style which I do not fully understand and I think
it is important that I should. I do not like not knowing things and I feel
stupid when talking to people who know more about programming languages.

I think Haskell is probably the best choice as a language to learn functional
programming because, unlike lisp, it does its best to be <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional">purely functional</a>,
that is functions have no side effects. This should force me to do things
properly. It seems to be becoming quite popular so there is a chance people
may even start to use it for things other than research. Also, I studied at
Glasgow, home of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). I'm actually in Edinburgh
at the moment, home of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML</a> but if
you have a look in lib.ed.ac.uk, you will see hunners (a Glaswegian term) of
Haskell books, not ML.

Another good choice for learning functional programming would be <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</a>, also called SICP and the Wizard Book, which uses scheme. I
suspect it is worth following this course even if you do already know how to
program functionally as it is generally highly thought of and I know of good
programmers who have found it useful, despite it being designed as first year
course.

I first saw Haskell in second year at Glasgow when I went to a few classes on
it. I was studying electronics too though so couldn't officially take the
class and I didn't get very far. It seems I have now ended up using the
Glasgow Haskell Compiler for the first time here in Edinburgh. :)

Compilers and books then, which should you use? I am reading <a
href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/craft2e">Thompson</a>. This
was used for the course in Glasgow and also fills the shelves of the Edinburgh
University library. I noticed on the book website there is actually a <a
href="http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html"> third edition</a> now.

A rather more trendy book is <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You
a Haskell for Great Good!</a>. I am told this is less dry than Thomson but I'm
not sure if soggy books are a good thing. It does have a nice picture of an
elephant on the cover though and pretty colours on the website.

What about a compiler and interpreter? An interactive interpreter, or REPL
(Read Eval Print Loop) as lispers call it, is certainly a good thing to have
and learn with. Thompson uses <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hugs/">HUGS</a>,
which I started with but the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>
also has an interpreter, GHCi, which I have now switched to. I note that the
latest edition of Thompson uses GHCi too. GHC seems to be the standard
compiler so I would recommend using it. See also <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Implementations">Haskell
Implementations</a>.

Back to what I'm doing to learn Haskell then. I'm now on Chapter 14 of
Thompson, Algebraic Types, but skipped most of the exercises, which I intend to
go back to. I'm also doing <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project
Euler</a>. These mathematical problems seem well suited to a mathematical sort
of language like Haskell but perhaps this is making it too easy. There is the
old question of whether functional languages are suited to real problems, and
the fact that I won't know how to print "Hello, world!" until Chapter
18.

I think I'll leave it at that for now but I intend to say more in further
posts.]]></content>

    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/05/25/Arduino-Getting-started-with-Seeeduino</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I have been meaning to do several microcontroller based projects for some time
now. Ideally I wanted to do it without spending any money so I decided to make
myself a PIC programmer with some samples from Microchip. This would also make
the process more interesting.

The plan was to make a <a href="http://usbpicprog.org/">usbpicprog</a> and
bootstrap it with a serial port based programmer using an old computer.  I
bought all the parts, including copper clad board and ferric chloride but
never quite got round to doing it. This was in part because I was not very
keen to have to work with ferric chloride and I didn't want to dissolve the
sink.

Meanwhile, I had been hearing about the Arduino more and more. Initially I
ignored it as something for artists and people who didn't know what they were
doing. I had spent some time at university learning about and using real
microcontrollers with none of this boot loader nonsense so I did not think I
needed such things. Then I realised that being leet enough not to require
simplification did not make quicker development a bad thing. :-) I decided I
had wasted enough time and just wanted to get something done, so I bought an
Arduino.

<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5223/5773580603_eee48af87b.jpg"
width="500" height="375" alt="Seeeduino and ethernet shield">

I actually chose the seeedunio, an Arduino clone. The design is open so this
is allowed and in fact there are some improvements made in the
seeeduino. Primarily I chose it though because it was the cheapest. I still
don't like the idea of paying decapounds for a single basic microcontroller
and some soldering. I also ordered an ethernet shield, which is what an
expansion card is called in the Arduino world. These arrived yesterday.

It took me longer than I would have liked to get started, with the blinking LED
hello world of microcontrollers, because there were no instructions about the
correct settings. After some googling and trial and error I determined that I
had to set the reset switch on the board to auto and, in the Arduino IDE, set
the board type to <type>Deumilanove or Nano w/ ATmega328</type>.  After that
I very quickly had it beaconing my callsign on the board mounted LED attached
to pin 13. So far quite reasonable.

Then I decided to plug in the ethernet board and run the example programs.  I
had to stick all the source files in the same directory and change the ip
address and then I was pinging the board. It took only a few minutes. This I
thought was pretty ridiculous. Then I used the web server program. It
worked. I couldn't really believe this - this did not seem like electronics at
all. I would expect this to have taken weeks of debugging, loose wires, errors
in PCB design, software bugs and frustration but here it was working in a few
minutes with no test gear in sight. I have certainly confirmed my get things
done faster conjecture.

It was not quite as good though when I wanted to connect stuff up to it. The
board did not come with a data sheet and I could not find much at all online.
In the end I went to Atmel's web site and downloaded the datasheet for the
ATmega328P on my board. Included below are some useful figures from it.

Reference
=========

Seeeduino - Summary of Initial Setup
-----------------------------------

I am using the Seeeduino V2.21 which is also marked ARD128D2P.

It uses the ATmega328P.

This is the error I got initially:

<code>avrdude: stk500_disable(): protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x00</code>

The solution:

- Move reset switch to auto
- Set board type to <code>Deumilanove or Nano w/ ATmega328</code>.

ATmega328P Data
===============

Absolute Maximums
-----------------

<table>
<tr><td>Operating Temperature</td><td>-55°C to +125°C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voltage on any Pin except RESET with respect to Ground</td> <td>-0.5V to VCC+0.5V</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum Operating Voltage</td><td>6.0V</td></tr>
<tr><td>DC Current per I/O Pin</td><td>40.0mA</tr>
<tr><td>DC Current VCC and GND Pins</td><td>200.0mA</td></tr>
</table>

Programming
-----------

The Arduino environment uses C but with some magic, see
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/BuildProcess">Arduino Build Process</a>.


Ethernet board
--------------

It's ENC28J60 based. This is not the same as the official one, which uses the
Wiznet W5100.

Bought from <a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend we had the <a
href="http://www.pythonedinburgh.org/wiki/2011-May-Mini-Conference">Python
Edinburgh Mini Conference</a>. I don't really use python, as I typically use
perl for the sorts of things I might want it for, but I thought it would be
interesting to go along and see what was happening in the python world.

I thought it would probably be helpful if I actually knew some python, so on
Friday night after the pub I went home to learn. It's just pseudocode with
spaces, right? I wasn't actually a complete beginner - I had a play with it a
couple of months ago when I wrote map and reduce scripts to implement a search
indexer with Hadoop and solved a few of the Project Euler problems.

It looked like the conference was going to have a large django component so I
did the <a
href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">tutorial</a>. It
was very straightforward and I had an application running that evening. My
main concern with the tutorial was that there was no magical pony on a stick.

/>

I discovered <a href="http://www.tipfy.org">Tipfy</a>, a framework for Google
App Engine. One of the things that got me wondering if I should be using more
python and less perl is that there are PaaS providers only for the former, so
this is probably worth looking at more closely. I've also heard good things
about <a href="http://www.nltk.org">NLTK</a> which I would like to play with
some time.]]></content>

My work is fairly evenly spread out, as I would expect. It looks like
I don't work much on Fridays or Saturday nights though. How strange.

I'm sure there are various fun things I could do with this sort of
data. Perhaps classify coders into categories like crepuscular,
diurnal, and nocturnal. What about matching up to people who like to
work at the same time? Or sleep at the same time. :-) I must make a
hacker dating site at once.

    <link href="http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/03/10/rewriting-git-commit-message-history.html"/>
    <updated>2011-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://mm0hai.net/blog/2011/03/10/rewriting-git-commit-message-history</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[The usual way to modify a previous git commit is to rebase interactively:

<pre><code class="block">git rebase -i &lt;parent of oldest commit to edit&gt;</code></pre>

This lets you modify the past commit and then it reapplies all commits
in the current branch since then on top of the modified commit.

This is all you need if you only have one branch. This time, however,
I had multiple branches splitting off after the commit I had to
change. When I used the rebase technique, the other branches remained
along with the unmodified commit they were based on.

I decided to try a different approach - I used <code>filter-branch</code>.

`filter-branch` is very powerful and has many options. In this case, I
only wanted to rewrite a commit message, so I used the
<code>--msg-filter</code> option. This pipes each message to a shell
command and replaces it with the output of that command - perfect in
conjunction with sed. This method, unlike rebasing onto a single
edited commit, lets you programmatically edit all commit messages

One of the things I wanted to do was remove the comments that had been
added by git-svn. This command did the trick:

<code class="block">git filter-branch -f --msg-filter 'sed "s/git-svn.*$//g"' -- --all</code>

If you have any tags, you should add <code>--tag-name-filter cat</code>. This
updates the tags to point to the modified commits. It's more complicated if
the tags are signed - see the <code>git-fliter-branch</code> man page for
details.

Before this operation, git makes a backup, referred to as the
original. If there is already a backup git will, be default, refuse to
run the command, as doing so would overwrite the existing backup with
a new one. Use `-f` to force it.

`-- --all` applies the filter to all branches. Alternatively, single
branch names can be given.

The above commands have taken care of modifying our commits but they
have not removed the originals, which have been kept as backups. To
purge these from the repository, you need to remove all references to
them and then run the garbage collector.

Edit these files to delete any lines which refer to the original commits:
<pre class="block">
<code class="block">
.git/info/refs
.git/packed-refs
</code>
</pre>

And do this:
<pre class="block">
<code class="block">
rm -rf .git/refs/original
rm -rf .git/logs/
</code>
</pre>

Now garbage collect:
<pre class="block">
<code class="block">
git gc --prune=now
</code>
</pre>
