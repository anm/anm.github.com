    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4617/38954774364_5feccd0c4f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20180108_091225" /></p>

<p>There is sailing, and there is living on a boat. I’ve done both recently, but
you might be surprised how little these normally go together. Anyway, this is
what I think of living on a boat after doing it for most of a year.</p>

<p>Mostly, I really like it.</p>

<p>The boat is the first place I have had for myself. It was strange to realise
that I now own a fridge, and an oven, and a vacuum cleaner. I’ve been
travelling for a while, and still do, but now I do it with an oven. :)</p>

<p>I feel like living on a boat is the way you can have the most control over
your environment - the only way you can really own your place. People talk
about owning houses, but I don’t think it is really possible, certainly not in
places I have seen like British cities. Is it really yours when you have
council tax, planning permission, conditions in deeds, factors, residents
associations? Some places you have almost no control over what you can do with
“your” flat, and are made to pay other people for the right to exist. This is
not ownership. With the boat, I can do what I want with it, and put it where I
want. Yes, there are harbour fees, but these are optional, and it’s easy to
move if you don’t like a place. There is also the ancient right to anchor
pretty much anywhere, and except in some places noöne can take money from you
or interfere.</p>

<p>I can provide everything for myself. Electricity from solar panels. Water can
be collected from rain or desalinated on solar power. Toilets, plumbing,
communications is all within your own control. I have my own network on the
boat with backhaul by wifi, mobile networks, or potentially satellite or HF
radio.</p>

<p>On the boat I have everything I need almost literally within arms reach. I can
easily carry food for months. I could, and have, anchored somewhere for weeks
without needing anything from the outside world.</p>

<p>I have also noticed how much energy and water I use, compared to on land. On
the boat I have footpumps for water, and can control exactly how much I
use. On land, the tap flows constantly while using it, and at a much greater
rate. The amount of energy used for heating houses is ridiculous. A whole
house can be heated just for one or two people. On the boat, even if I heat it
all, the space is much smaller, but mostly I don’t even do that. I blow hot
air inside a blanket or cloak, or just sit on an electric blanket. Also tea is
a very efficient way to transfer heat into the body.</p>

<p>The main restriction to freedom with the boat life is, I think, simply owning
something. Anything, and especially a boat, is something that needs to be
looked after, maintained, repaired, stored, checked on… It’s slower to move
the boat that to hitchhike for example. Probably the way to be most free is to
have nothing and trust in the universe. It probably comes with less comfort
than always having your own bed with you when you travel, though.</p>

<p>Most of the time on the boat I was living with a girlfriend. I think this is a
good idea and works well as long as you get on well enough. More recently
though I’ve been on my own, which I also like. It’s an excellent way to be a
hermit. After my first passage on my own I tied up on a small lake off the
Kiel canal. There were no other boats there, and I was very happy on my own. I
had a party with myself and the boat and the lake and the trees.</p>

<p>Problems I’ve had with this particular boat more recently are condensation and
mould. Living on a boat in the winter it really should be insulated. It’s also
cold, but now that it is properly cold, I actually sort of like the ice on the
windows and frost on deck.</p>

<p>Another thing I like is the general awareness of nature that comes from being
on the boat. Apart from explicitly checking the weather when sailing, I still
notice much more just being on the boat. I discovered seasons are a real
thing. This is largely because of being in Scandinavia instead of Scotland,
where we only have a vague idea of seasons - winter is a bit wetter and
colder, but it is a gradual thing and just a matter of degree. Around
Scandinavia it can be Summer one day and Autumn the next. On Samhain eve (the
end of Summer / Autumn) it was warm, in the morning there was ice on the
deck. I notice the temperature of course, but last night I woke up because the
wind changed. The boat makes slightly different sounds, the waves slap the
hull from a different angle, things tap differently. Even when tied up
somewhere calm with no plans to sail I still feel where the wind is coming
from when I’m asleep.</p>

<p>Another good thing about a boat is that you can avoid winter totally if you
want. Just move house to where it is Summer at that time of the year!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In English, it’s hard to know what to call that thing you are tying your boat
up to. It could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pier</li>
  <li>Jetty</li>
  <li>Berth</li>
  <li>Dock</li>
  <li>Wharf</li>
  <li>Quay</li>
  <li>Pontoon</li>
  <li>Mole</li>
  <li>Slip (American English)</li>
</ul>

<p>The definitions of all these terms depend on if you are speaking English or
American, and also seem to be rather fuzzy. However, there is an easy solution:</p>

<p><strong>Brygge</strong></p>

<p>It’s much easier if you just use the Scandinavian term. Everything is a brygge
(or brygga, bryggen). It’s possible, but not necessary to be more precise
about what kind of brygge it is, for example a flytebrygge is a floaty brygge,
or pontoon, but it’s always a brygge. This word I have imported into English,
and it makes life a lot easier.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5836/30583122980_5ebe6a8ef3_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="2 Cats 1 Boat - Scampi 30" /></p>

<p>After sailing on other people’s boats for a while, I finally got my own. I’m
planning to live aboard and travel. It seems like a good way to have more
comfort than most ways of travelling - you take your bed, kitchen, etc. with
you - but you are not stuck in one place as you are with a house. For the
moment the boat is on land in Stockholm, but in the Spring we should be ready
to go.</p>

<p>The boat is a Shipman Scampi, better known as Albin Scampi, as Albin also
built them. 30ft, made in Sweden around 40 years ago. Quite light displacement
and meant for racing, but hopefully will serve for cruising. She needs some
work, but overall not a bad deal.</p>

<p>I bought this boat after hitchhiking around Sweden, looking mostly at the Albin
Vega, until Autumn when prices on larger boats like this dropped. I heard
Sweden is a good place to buy a boat, and they certainly do seem cheaper here
than in the UK and probably most of Europe. Swedish boats do not, however,
seem to be well equipped to go to sea, as British ones more often are. I think
this is because they are usually just used around the islands here, so there
is more work to do, like adding anchors, tender, vhf radio!</p>

    <link href="https://mm0hai.net/blog/2013/09/30/San-Blas.html"/>
    <updated>2013-09-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are various ways to get from Panama to Colombia: flying, cargo boat in
the Pacific, small cargo launches between islands in the Caribbean, and a
sailing yacht in the Caribbean are some of the options. Travel by land is a
serious undertaking and very rarely done. The area between the countries is
called the Darien Gap: here there is a break in the Panamerican Highway, and
nothing but thick jungle and various natural and man made dangers. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme">difficulty Scots had living
here</a> is one reason why Scotland joined with England and became Great
Britain.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a boat anyway, and preferably a bigger sailing to keep my
bike away from the salt. I tried hitchiking from Portobelo and Puerto Lindo,
but in the end decided just to pay the tourist rate for a berth on the
Santana. Although very expensive, it was not a bad decision. The San Blas
islands along the Panama coast are the classic tropical islands, many with
nothing but sand and a few palm trees.</p>

<p>I joined the boat in Puerto Lindo. It turned out the wrapping was not really
necessary.</p>

<p>Officially leaving Panama was the easiest border so far. The captain took our
passports to this office while we did nothing.</p>

<p>It is obviously a popular place for cruisers.</p>

<p>The Kuna people inhabit these islands. I don’t know how they manage with so
little resources, but one thing they do now is sell lobsters and beaded
jewellery to tourists on the big boats.</p>
